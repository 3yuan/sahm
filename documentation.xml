    <Title>PARC</Title>
    <Description>The Projection, Aggregation, Resampling, and Clipping (PARC) module is a powerful utility that automates the preparation steps required for using raster layers in most geospatial modeling packages. In order to successfully consider multiple environmental predictors in raster format, each layer must have coincident cells (pixels) of the same size, have the same coordinate system (and projection, if applicable), and the same geographic extent. The PARC module ensures that all of these conditions are met for the input layers by transforming and or reprojecting each raster to match the coordinate system of the template layer. This process usually involves aggregation (necessary when an input raster layer must be up-scaled to match the template layer-- e.g., generalizing a 10 m input layer to a 100 m output layer), and or resampling (necessary for interpolating new cell values when transforming the raster layer to the coordinate space or cell size of the template layer). Lastly, each raster predictor layer is clipped to match the extent of the template layer.

The settings used during these processing steps follow a particular set of decision rules designed to preserve the integrity of data as much as possible. However, it is important for a user to understand how these processing steps may modify the data inputs. For additional information about the PARC module, please see the extended help and documentation for the SAHM package. </Description>

        <PortName>RastersWithPARCInfoCSV</PortName>
        <Definition>This is a CSV containing a list of files to include in the PARC operation.

The format of this list conforms to the 'PredictorListFile' specs:
    Column 1: The full file path to the input raster layer including the drive.
    Column 2: A binary value indicating whether the input layer is categorical or not. A value of "0" indicates that an input raster is non-categorical data (continuous), while a value of "1" indicates that an input raster is categorical data.
    Column 3: The resampling method employed to interpolate new cell values when transforming the raster layer to the coordinate space or cell size of the template layer, if necessary. The resampling type should be specified using one of the following values: "nearestneighbor," "bilinear," "cubic," or "lanczos."
    Column 4: The aggregation method to be used in the event that the raster layer must be up-scaled to match the template layer (e.g., generalizing a 10 m input layer to a 100 m output layer). Care should be taken to ensure that the aggregation method that best preserves the integrity of the data is used. The aggregation should be specified using one of the following values: "Min," "Mean," "Max," "Majority," or "None."

In formatting the list of predictor files, the titles assigned to each of the columns are unimportant as the module retrieves the information based on the order of the values in the .csv file (the ordering of the information and the permissible values in the file however, are strictly enforced). The module also anticipates a header row and will ignore the first row in the .csv file.</Definition>

    <Title>RasterFormatConverter</Title>
    <Description>The RasterFormatConverter module allows a user to easily convert between raster file types for a group of rasters. This group can be specified as either all the rasters in a single directory or the rasters specified in a single MDS file (see below).  All outputs will be sent to a folder named "ConvertedRasters" (followed by an underscore and a number corresponding to the run sequence of the module) within the user’s current VisTrail’s session folder.  Typically this module will be used within a workflow to convert the geotiff format used by the rest of the modules to the ascii format needed by Maxent.  But the following file formats are accepted for both inputs and outputs: Arc/Info ASCII Grid, ESRI BIL, ERDAS Imagine, and JPEG and others.

        <Definition>Model residual plots show the spatial relationship between the model deviance residuals.  Most models assume residuals will be independent thus spatial pattern in the deviance residuals can be indicative of a problem with the model fit and inference based on the fit.  It can for example indicate that important predictors were not included in the model and can be compared with the spatial pattern of predictors that were not included in the model.  Whether or not a significant spatial pattern exists in model residuals can at times be difficult to assess visually.  We hope to add correlograms of Moran’s I soon.  Unfortunately statistical tests based on the Moran’s I statistic for residuals of binary response models lack statistical justification and thus cannot be used to test for a significant spatial pattern (Bivand 2008).   See Dormann 2007 for more discussion on evaluation of model residuals and spatial models that are appropriate for species distribution modeling.  Residual plots can also be used to determine if certain observations contribute disproportionately to the deviance of the fitted model.  For a binary response model deviance residuals with absolute values greater than 2 can be indicative of a problem.</Definition>

        <PortName>MessMap</PortName>
        <Definition>If specified by selecting makeMESMap=TRUE the the MESS and MOD surfaces will be produced.  The MESS surface is the multivariate environment similarity surface and shows how well each point fits into the univariate ranges of the points for which the model was fit.  Negative values in this map indicate that the point is out of the range of the training data.  The MoD map is related and indicates which variable was furthest from the range over which the model was.  The MESS map takes the minimum value of a statistic calculate for each predictor and thus cannot diagnose hidden extrapolation as one might do using a hat matrix.  This surface is only calculated for variables that are selected in the model selection step within each model fitting algorithm so that variables that do not significantly affect the occurrence of the organism over the range of the training data will not be included in the MESS map even though these predictors might be significant outside the range in which the model was fit.  Random Forest never drops predictors so if one wishes to compare the MESS and Mod map before and after insignificant predictors were dropped, one can compare the MESS map of a Random Forest fit to that produced from the other model fit algorithms as long as they were fit using the same dataset.  See Elith et. al. 2010 for details on how the MESS map calculations are performed.</Definition>

        <Definition>Model response curves show the relationship between each predictor included in the model, while holding all other predictors constant at their means, and the fitted values.  MARS response curves are shown on a logit scale thus the response axis will not necessarily be bounded on the 0 to 1 interval.  BRT response curves will show response surfaces for any interaction terms included in the final model along with the percent relative influence.</Definition>

        <Definition>This file contains a summary of  the model fit.  The information contained here includes the number of presence observations (counts equal to or greater than 1 for count models), the number of absence points, the number of covariates that were considered by the model selection algorithm.  Note all of these can differ from the numbers in the original .mds due to incomplete records being deleted, and predictors with only one unique value being removed.  The random number seed is recorded if applicable which allows completely reproducible results as well as a summary of the model fit.  Evaluation Statistics are reported for the data used to fit the model as well as for the test or cross-validation split if applicable.  References for how to interpret most of these are ubiquitous in the literature but it is worth mentioning that interpretation of the calibration statistics is described by Pearce and Ferrier 2000 as well as Miller and Hui 1991.  Most metrics reported here can also be found in related graphical displays.</Definition>

    <Title>ModelSelectionSplit</Title>
    <Description>
    The ModelSelectionSplit reserves a portion of the data from the model fitting 
process but reports the evaluation metrics on all models not just the those selected as the 
final models to be reported in the analysis (in contrast to the ModelEvaluationSplit).  This module 
can be placed either directly before or directly after the CovariateCorrelationAndSelection.  If both a 
ModelEvaluationSplit and a ModelSelectionSplit are specified then the training portion of the ModelEvalutationSplit will 
be further partitioned by the ModelSelectionSplit thus the ModelEvalutationSplit should come 
first in the workflow.  Both of these algorithms stratify the splits by the response.  
That is, the ratio of presence to absence points should be nearly equal in the testing 
and training split.  If a ModelSelectionSplit is included evaluation metrics applied to 
the reserved data will be reported in the textual output, model evaluation plots including 
AUC plots as well as the across model plots and the csv.  Both of these modules ignore 
background points and treat all observations with values greater than 0 as presence 
for the purpose of stratification by response. Three parameters can be set by the user for each of these modules:

       1.	Ratio of Presence/Absence Points: This optional field is populated with a number corresponding 
         to the desired ratio of presence to  absence points to be used in the analysis. If not populated 
         then all occurrence records (not background points) will be portioned into either the test or 
         training split with no reduction in the total number of points.  If populated, this entry should 
         be a number greater than zero. (A value of '1' will result in an equal number of both presence 
         and absence points being used, a value of '2' indicates that twice as many presence points 
         will be used, a value of '0.5' indicates that twice as many absence points will be used, etc.). 
         All field data points with a value equal to or greater than 1 are interpreted as presence points. 
         Although the original field data is unmodified, this option will reduce the sample size as the 
         merged dataset containing sample points will have points deleted from it to achieve the 
         specified ratio as such it should be used with caution. A warning will be generated if 
         more than 50% of either the presence or absence points will be deleted based on the ratio 
         specified by the user. Background points are ignored by this module (they are read in 
         and written out, but not assigned to either the test or training split).
		
         2.	Input Merged Data Set (MDS): This is the input data set consisting of location data for each sample 
         point, the values of each predictor variable at those points, and if established, a field denoting the 
         weight that will be assigned to each point in modeling. This input is usually provided by the upstream 
         steps that precede the Test Training Split module. Any value entered here (e.g., specifying another 
         existing MDS on the file system) will override the input specified by a model connection in the visual display.

         3.	 Training Proportion: This is the proportion of the sample points that will be used to train the model, 
         relative to the total number of points. Entered values should be greater than 0 but less than 1. For example, 
         a value of '0.9' will result in 90% of the sample points being used to train the model, with 10% of the sample 
         being held out to test the model's performance. Choosing an appropriate training proportion can depend on various 
         factors, such as the total number of sample points available.  Selecting an appropriate value for the training 
         proportion is a complex issue that depends on many factors including the total number of observations, the 
         complexity of the models that will be fit, and the signal to noise ratio in the data (Hastie et. al. 2009). 
		
    It is not valid to select models based on their performance on the reserved portion of the data and then report these 
metrics only for the top performing models claiming that we would expect similar performance on an independent dataset see Hastie 2009 for 
this discussion.  If one desires metrics for how the models might be expected to perform on an independent dataset then the ModelEvaluationSplit 
must be used.

    <Title>MDSBuilder</Title>
    <Description>
    MDS Builder

    The Merged Data Set (MDS) Builder module is a utility that extracts the values of each predictor
    layer to the point locations included in the field data set. The module produces a .csv file that
    contains the x and y locations of the sample points and a column indicating whether each point
    represents a presence recording, an absence recording, a presence count, or a background point.
    Following these first three columns, each environmental predictor layer is appended as a column
    with row entries representing the value present in the raster layer at each field sample point.
    There are a total of three header rows in the output .csv of the MDSBuilder. The first row contains
    the columns "x," "y," "ResponseBinary" or "ResponseCount," and the names of each of the raster
    predictor files that were passed to the MDS Builder. The second row contains a binary value
    indicating whether the column should be included when the model is finally applied; these values
    are later modified during the Covariate Correlation and Selection process that takes place downstream
    in the workflow. The final header row contains the full path on the file system to each of the raster
    predictor files.

    The MDSBuilder accepts four inputs from the user:

    1. Rasters with PARC Info .csv File: The raster layers listed in this file will have their values
    extracted to the points in the field data .csv file. This parameter should be supplied by connecting
    the output of a PARC module within the workflow to the MDSBuilder module. (In order to properly
    extract the values of each predictor layer to the field data points, all the layers must have matching
    coordinate systems and cell sizes; outputs from the PARC module will have had the prerequisite processing).
    
    2. Background Point Count: This is an optional value that applies only to workflows that employ the
    Maxent modeling package. The dialogue box provides the option of specifying a number of background points
    to be randomly scattered throughout the study area (the extent of the template layer) to capture a more
    complete sample of the range of values present for each predictor layer. These points will be added to
    the field data .csv file with a value of "-9999" denoting them as background points.
    
    3. Background Probability Surface: This is an optional parameter that applies only to workflows that
    employ the Maxent modeling package. In some analyses, it may be appropriate to spatially limit background
    points to a particular subset of the study area (e.g., islands within a study area polygon, particular
    regions within a study area polygon, or a region determined by the known bias present in the field data).
    Specifying a background probability surface raster allows a user to control where random points will be
    scattered within the extent of the study area. The raster layer specified by a user should have the same
    projection and extent as the template layer and contain values ranging from 0 to 100. These values represent
    the probability that a randomly generated point will be retained should it fall within a particular cell.
    That is, randomly generated points will not be generated in any part of the probability grid with a value
    of "0" while all points falling in an area with a value of "100" will be retained. A point falling in an
    area with a value of "50" will be kept as a background point 50% of the time.
    
    4. Field Data: The field data input corresponds to a .csv file containing presence/absence points or count
    data recorded across a landscape for the phenomenon being modeled (e.g., plant sightings, evidence of
    animal presence, etc.). This input file must be in a particular format, and in most cases, a user should
    populate this field by connecting a FieldData element to the MDSBuilder in the visual display within VisTrails.
    Please see the documention for the FieldData module for more details.

    <Description>
    FieldDataQuery
        
    This module provides convienence functions for selecting the pertinent columns in a
    raw field data file.  Also provided are functions for selecting the rows in the file
    to include based on the values in another column.
    
    columns can be specified with either a number (1 based) or the header string name.
    The string is not case sensitive and does not need to be enclosed in quotes.
    if the name or number of any of the columns cannot be found an error will be thrown.
    
    For the Query column you can either enter an equality statement with x used as a 
        placeholder to represent the values in the query column or you can construct 
        more involved queries using Python syntax.
        
        For example:
            x &lt; 2005 (would return values less than 2005)
            x == 2000 or x == 2009 (would return 2000 or 2009)
            The syntax is python in case you want to create an involved query.

        <Definition>Model residual plots show the spatial relationship between the model deviance residuals.  Most models assume residuals will be independent thus spatial pattern in the deviance residuals can be indicative of a problem with the model fit and inference based on the fit.  It can for example indicate that important predictors were not included in the model and can be compared with the spatial pattern of predictors that were not included in the model.  Whether or not a significant spatial pattern exists in model residuals can at times be difficult to assess visually.  We hope to add correlograms of Moran’s I soon.  Unfortunately statistical tests based on the Moran’s I statistic for residuals of binary response models lack statistical justification and thus cannot be used to test for a significant spatial pattern (Bivand 2008).   See Dormann 2007 for more discussion on evaluation of model residuals and spatial models that are appropriate for species distribution modeling.  Residual plots can also be used to determine if certain observations contribute disproportionately to the deviance of the fitted model.  For a binary response model deviance residuals with absolute values greater than 2 can be indicative of a problem.</Definition>

        <PortName>MessMap</PortName>
        <Definition>If specified by selecting makeMESMap=TRUE the the MESS and MOD surfaces will be produced.  The MESS surface is the multivariate environment similarity surface and shows how well each point fits into the univariate ranges of the points for which the model was fit.  Negative values in this map indicate that the point is out of the range of the training data.  The MoD map is related and indicates which variable was furthest from the range over which the model was.  The MESS map takes the minimum value of a statistic calculate for each predictor and thus cannot diagnose hidden extrapolation as one might do using a hat matrix.  This surface is only calculated for variables that are selected in the model selection step within each model fitting algorithm so that variables that do not significantly affect the occurrence of the organism over the range of the training data will not be included in the MESS map even though these predictors might be significant outside the range in which the model was fit.  Random Forest never drops predictors so if one wishes to compare the MESS and Mod map before and after insignificant predictors were dropped, one can compare the MESS map of a Random Forest fit to that produced from the other model fit algorithms as long as they were fit using the same dataset.  See Elith et. al. 2010 for details on how the MESS map calculations are performed.</Definition>

    <Title>ModelEvaluationSplit</Title>
    <Description>
     The ModelEvaluationSplit module provides the opportunity to reserve a specified portion of the data for 
    producing and reporting evaluation metrics on an independent test set following model exploration and selection.  
    The ModelEvaluationSplit must be applied before the CovariateCorrelationAndSelection module.  
    The nearly identical ModelSelectionSplit reserves a portion of the data from the model fitting 
    process but reports the evaluation metrics on all models not just the those selected as the 
    final models to be reported in the analysis.  This module can be placed either directly before 
    or directly after the CovariateCorrelationAndSelection.  If both a ModelEvaluationSplit and a 
    ModelSelectionSplit are specified then the training portion of the ModelEvalutationSplit will 
    be further partitioned by the ModelSelectionSplit thus the ModelEvalutationSplit should come 
    first in the workflow.  Both of these algorithms stratify the splits by the response.  
    That is, the ratio of presence to absence points should be nearly equal in the testing 
    and training split.  If a ModelSelectionSplit is included evaluation metrics applied to 
    the reserved data will be reported in the textual output, model evaluation plots including 
    AUC plots as well as the across model plots and the csv.  Both of these modules ignore 
    background points and treat all observations with values greater than 0 as presence 
    for the purpose of stratification by response. Three parameters can be set by the user for each of these modules: 

		1.	Ratio of Presence/Absence Points: This optional field is populated with a number corresponding 
		to the desired ratio of presence to  absence points to be used in the analysis. If not populated 
		then all occurrence records (not background points) will be portioned into either the test or 
		training split with no reduction in the total number of points.  If populated, this entry should 
		be a number greater than zero. (A value of '1' will result in an equal number of both presence 
		and absence points being used, a value of '2' indicates that twice as many presence points 
		will be used, a value of '0.5' indicates that twice as many absence points will be used, etc.). 
		All field data points with a value equal to or greater than 1 are interpreted as presence points. 
		Although the original field data is unmodified, this option will reduce the sample size as the 
		merged dataset containing sample points will have points deleted from it to achieve the 
		specified ratio as such it should be used with caution. A warning will be generated if 
		more than 50% of either the presence or absence points will be deleted based on the ratio 
		specified by the user. Background points are ignored by this module (they are read in 
		and written out, but not assigned to either the test or training split).
		
		2.	Input Merged Data Set (MDS): This is the input data set consisting of location data for each sample 
	    point, the values of each predictor variable at those points, and if established, a field denoting the 
	    weight that will be assigned to each point in modeling. This input is usually provided by the upstream 
	    steps that precede the Test Training Split module. Any value entered here (e.g., specifying another 
	    existing MDS on the file system) will override the input specified by a model connection in the visual display.

		3.	 Training Proportion: This is the proportion of the sample points that will be used to train the model, 
		relative to the total number of points. Entered values should be greater than 0 but less than 1. For example, 
		a value of '0.9' will result in 90% of the sample points being used to train the model, with 10% of the sample 
		being held out to test the model's performance. Choosing an appropriate training proportion can depend on various 
		factors, such as the total number of sample points available.  Selecting an appropriate value for the training 
		proportion is a complex issue that depends on many factors including the total number of observations, the 
		complexity of the models that will be fit, and the signal to noise ratio in the data (Hastie et. al. 2009).

    <Title>GLM</Title>
    <Description>This is basically linear regression adapted to binary presence-absence or count data.  We used a bidirectional stepwise procedure to select covariates to be used in the model.  That is, we began with a null model and calculated the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) score for each covariate which could be added to the model.  AIC is a measure of how well the model fits the data with a penalty based on the number of covariates in the model.  In the first step, we add the covariate with the best AIC score.  In the next step we calculate AIC scores for all two-covariate models and again add the covariate that most improves the AIC, and so on.  At each step, we also look at the change in AIC from dropping each covariate currently in the model.  The stepwise procedure ends when no additions or removals result in an improvement in AIC.

        <Definition>Model residual plots show the spatial relationship between the model deviance residuals.  Most models assume residuals will be independent thus spatial pattern in the deviance residuals can be indicative of a problem with the model fit and inference based on the fit.  It can for example indicate that important predictors were not included in the model and can be compared with the spatial pattern of predictors that were not included in the model.  Whether or not a significant spatial pattern exists in model residuals can at times be difficult to assess visually.  We hope to add correlograms of Moran’s I soon.  Unfortunately statistical tests based on the Moran’s I statistic for residuals of binary response models lack statistical justification and thus cannot be used to test for a significant spatial pattern (Bivand 2008).   See Dormann 2007 for more discussion on evaluation of model residuals and spatial models that are appropriate for species distribution modeling.  Residual plots can also be used to determine if certain observations contribute disproportionately to the deviance of the fitted model.  For a binary response model deviance residuals with absolute values greater than 2 can be indicative of a problem.</Definition>

        <Definition>If specified by selecting makeMESMap=TRUE the the MESS and MOD surfaces will be produced.  The MESS surface is the multivariate environment similarity surface and shows how well each point fits into the univariate ranges of the points for which the model was fit.  Negative values in this map indicate that the point is out of the range of the training data.  The MoD map is related and indicates which variable was furthest from the range over which the model was.  The MESS map takes the minimum value of a statistic calculate for each predictor and thus cannot diagnose hidden extrapolation as one might do using a hat matrix.  This surface is only calculated for variables that are selected in the model selection step within each model fitting algorithm so that variables that do not significantly affect the occurrence of the organism over the range of the training data will not be included in the MESS map even though these predictors might be significant outside the range in which the model was fit.  Random Forest never drops predictors so if one wishes to compare the MESS and Mod map before and after insignificant predictors were dropped, one can compare the MESS map of a Random Forest fit to that produced from the other model fit algorithms as long as they were fit using the same dataset.  See Elith et. al. 2010 for details on how the MESS map calculations are performed.</Definition>

    <Title>ModelSelectionCrossValidation</Title>
    <Description>
    The ModelSelectionCrossValidation module provides another tool for model selection by splitting the field data observations into cross validation folds.  
    This should not be used with the ModelSelectionSplit but can be used with the ModelEvaluationSplit in which case only the training portion of the ModelEvalutationSplit 
    is partitioned into folds.  If specified then the individual models will fit a model using all of the data and report this as the training results.  Following the model 
    fitting step sub-models with be fit to each set of n-1 folds and then evaluation metrics calculated on the remaining fold.  These will show up as ranges in the AUC plot, 
    means and standard deviations are reported in textual output and box plots in across model comparison plots.  Evaluation metrics for each individual fold are reported 
    in the across model comparison csv.  The cross validation method incorporated here was originally written for evaluation of MARS models by Leathwick et. al. 2006.  
    
    The current implementation does not attempt any sort of model averaging but rather is only used for calculation of evaluation metrics.  The ModelSelectionCrossValidation 
    module makes better use of data then the ModelSelectionSplit as it uses all of the data to fit the final model but can be substantially more time consuming.   

       Under most circumstances the cross validation evaluation metrics reported by this module do not indicate how the the model might perform if applied to an independent 
       set of data but rather are to be used only for model selection purposes.  The first issue is that when cross validation is applied any feature selection based on the 
       relationship between the response and the predictors must be carried out on each cross validation training set.  The CovariateCorrelationAndSelection module includes 
       an exploration of the relationship between the predictors and the response and thus would need to be carried out for each for each cross validation training set.  
       The second issue is that it is invalid to use an evaluation metric for model selection and then report that metric for only the best performing model without 
       acknowledgement to the total number of models that were considered and the range of the evaluation metrics.  This module ignores background points.  
       
       Three parameters can be set by the user:
        1. Stratify:  Whether to stratify the folds by the response the default is to true
        
        2. Input Merged Data Set (MDS): This is the input data set consisting of locational data for each sample point, the values of each predictor variable at those points, 
        and if established, a field denoting the weight that will be assigned to each point in modeling. This input is usually provided by the upstream steps that precede the 
        Test Training Split module. Any value entered here (e.g., specifying another existing MDS on the file system) will override the input specified by a model connection 
        in the visual display.
        
        3. nFolds: The number of folds into which the data should be partitioned.  The default is 10.   A trade-off exists in selecting the number of folds to use for cross-validation.  
        When nFolds is close to the total number of observations the prediction error is nearly unbiased as the cross validation sample size is nearly equal to the total sample 
        size but because the training sets are nearly identical in this case variance of the prediction error can be quite high (Hastie et. al 2009).

    <Description>
    Predictor List File

    The PredictorListFile module allows a user to load a .csv file containing a list
    of rasters for consideration in the modeled analysis. The .csv file should contain
    a header row and four columns containing the following information, in order, for
    each raster input. 
    
    Column 1: The full file path to the input raster layer.
    
    Column 2: A binary value indicating whether the input layer is categorical or not.
    A value of "0" indicates that an input raster is non-categorical data (continuous),
    while a value of "1" indicates that an input raster is categorical data.
    
    Column 3: The resampling method employed to interpolate new cell values when
    transforming the raster layer to the coordinate space or cell size of the template
    layer, if necessary. The resampling type should be specified using one of the following
    values: "nearestneighbor," "bilinear," "cubic," or "lanczos."
    
    Column 4: The aggregation method to be used in the event that the raster layer
    must be up-scaled to match the template layer (e.g., generalizing a 10 m input layer to a
    100 m output layer). Care should be taken to ensure that the aggregation method that
    best preserves the integrity of the data is used. The aggregation should be specified
    using one of the following values: "Min," "Mean," "Max," "Majority," or "None."

    In formatting the list of predictor files, the titles assigned to each of the columns
    are unimportant as the module retrieves the information based on the order of the
    values in the .csv file (the ordering of the information and the permissible values
    in the file however, are strictly enforced). The module also anticipates a header row
    and will ignore the first row in the .csv file.

        <Definition>Model residual plots show the spatial relationship between the model deviance residuals.  Most models assume residuals will be independent thus spatial pattern in the deviance residuals can be indicative of a problem with the model fit and inference based on the fit.  It can for example indicate that important predictors were not included in the model and can be compared with the spatial pattern of predictors that were not included in the model.  Whether or not a significant spatial pattern exists in model residuals can at times be difficult to assess visually.  We hope to add correlograms of Moran’s I soon.  Unfortunately statistical tests based on the Moran’s I statistic for residuals of binary response models lack statistical justification and thus cannot be used to test for a significant spatial pattern (Bivand 2008).   See Dormann 2007 for more discussion on evaluation of model residuals and spatial models that are appropriate for species distribution modeling.  Residual plots can also be used to determine if certain observations contribute disproportionately to the deviance of the fitted model.  For a binary response model deviance residuals with absolute values greater than 2 can be indicative of a problem.</Definition>

        <PortName>MessMap</PortName>
        <Definition>If specified by selecting makeMESMap=TRUE the the MESS and MOD surfaces will be produced.  The MESS surface is the multivariate environment similarity surface and shows how well each point fits into the univariate ranges of the points for which the model was fit.  Negative values in this map indicate that the point is out of the range of the training data.  The MoD map is related and indicates which variable was furthest from the range over which the model was.  The MESS map takes the minimum value of a statistic calculate for each predictor and thus cannot diagnose hidden extrapolation as one might do using a hat matrix.  This surface is only calculated for variables that are selected in the model selection step within each model fitting algorithm so that variables that do not significantly affect the occurrence of the organism over the range of the training data will not be included in the MESS map even though these predictors might be significant outside the range in which the model was fit.  Random Forest never drops predictors so if one wishes to compare the MESS and Mod map before and after insignificant predictors were dropped, one can compare the MESS map of a Random Forest fit to that produced from the other model fit algorithms as long as they were fit using the same dataset.  See Elith et. al. 2010 for details on how the MESS map calculations are performed.</Definition>

The random number seed is recorded if applicable which allows completely reproducible results as well as a summary of the model fit.  Evaluation Statistics are reported for the data used to fit the model as well as for the test or cross-validation split if applicable.  References for how to interpret most of these are ubiquitous in the literature but it is worth mentioning that interpretation of the calibration statistics is described by Pearce and Ferrier 2000 as well as Miller and Hui 1991.

    <Description>
    Template Layer

    The TemplateLayer is a raster data layer with a defined coordinate system, a known cell size,
    and an extent that defines the study area. This raster layer serves as the template for all
    the other inputs in the analysis. All additional raster layers used in the analysis will be
    resampled and reprojected as needed to match the template, snapped to the template, and
    clipped to have an extent that matches the template. Users should ensure that any additional
    layers considered in the analysis have coverage within the extent of the template layer.

    The TemplateLayer is a required input for the PARC module.

    <Title>CovariateCorrelationAndSelection</Title>
    <Description>
    The CovariateCorrelationAndSelection view provides a breakpoint in the modeling workflow 
    for the user to assess how well each variable explains the distribution of the sampled 
    data points and to remove any variables that may exhibit high correlation with others. 
	The display shows the n variables that have the highest total number of correlations above 
	a threshold with other predictors using the maximum of the Pearson, Spearman and Kendall 
	coefficient. The column heading over each variable displays the number of other variables with which 
	the environmental predictor is correlated using the user supplied threshold which defaults to .7.  
	Radio buttons are available to limit the display and correlation calculations to any combination 
	of presence, absence, or background points.  The first column in the plot shows the relationship 
	between the response and each predictor.  Row labels indicate the maximum of the Spearman and Pearson 
	correlation coefficient and a locally weighted smooth has been added to help distinguish the nature of 
	the relationship.  

	The remaining plots make up a square with histograms for each variable displayed on the diagonal.  
	Their respective graphical display and correlation with other variables can be found by locating 
	the row/column intersection between each (above and below the diagonal).  The scatter plot along 
	with a locally weight smooth is shown below the diagonal.  Presence records are represented by 
	red points, absence by green, and background are yellow.  Above the diagonal is the correlation 
	coefficient between the two predictors.  If Spearman or Kendall correlation coefficient is larger 
	than the Pearson correlation coefficient then an s or k will show up in the bottom right corner of 
	this box.   

	A user is provided with the opportunity to select a new set of the environmental predictor variables 
	and "Update" the Covariate Correlation screen to investigate the relationships among the new variables 
	selected.  Variables with a high degree of correlation with other variables should generally be unchecked 
	in their respective radio buttons, and will be excluded from subsequent analysis steps in the model workflow.

	Multiple iterations can be run at this screen, allowing the user to investigate the relationships among the 
	environmental predictor variables and choose the most appropriate set to be used in the subsequent modeling. 
	When the desired set of variables has been chosen, the "OK" button is selected and processing will resume 
	in the VisTrails workflow.  Three parameters can/must be specified by the user:
	
	1.	ShowGUI : This Boolean indicates whether to stop execution and display the GUI for user interaction.  
	In some cases such as exploration you might want to make a selection in a previous run and then change this 
	to false so that the selection will be apply to subsequent runs without interrupting execution.
	
	2.	corsWithHighest: If one desires to view only other parameters that have a correlation above the specified 
	threshold with the parameter than has the highest number of total correlations with other parameters then this 
	should be set to true.  Otherwise, by default, the parameters that are selected for display will be the set of 
	parameters that have the highest number of correlations with other parameters above the given threshold.  
	
	3.	inputMDS : The file to select from.  If this file contains unselected layers (0 in the second header line) 
	these will initially appear deselected in the GUI.
	
	4.	minCor: The minimum correlation used to summarize the number of other variables each variable is highly 
	correlated with.
	
	5.	numPlots: The number of variables to display at a time in the plot frame.  
	
	6.	selectionName: This serves two purposes.  First to uniquely identify a given selection.  This unique name 
	is used to determine if a selection has been previously made, to apply for example.  And secondly to provide 
	something that can be changed to trigger VisTrails to rerun this module even if nothing upstream has changed.

    <Title>FieldData</Title>
    <Description>
    Field Data

    The FieldData module allows a user to add presence/absence points or count data recorded across a
    landscape for the phenomenon being modeled (e.g., plant sightings, evidence of animal presence, etc.).
    The input data for this module must be in the form of a .csv file that follows one of two formats: 

    Format 1
    A .csv file with the following column headings, in order: "X," "Y," and "responseBinary".
    In this case, the "X" field should be populated with the horizontal (longitudinal) positional
    data for a sample point. The "Y" field should be populated with the vertical (latitudinal) data
    for a sample point. These values must be in the same coordinate system/units as the template
    layer used in the workflow. The column "responseBinary" should be populated with either a '0'
    (indicating absence at the point) or a '1' (indicating presence at the point).

    Format 2
    A .csv file with the following column headings, in order: "X," "Y," and "responseCount".
    In this case, the "X" field should be populated with the horizontal (longitudinal) positional
    data for a sample point. The "Y" field should be populated with the vertical (latitudinal) data
    for a sample point. These values must be in the same coordinate system/units as the template
    layer used in the workflow. The column "responseCount" should be populated with either a '-9999'
    (indicating that the point is a background point) or a numerical value (either '0' or a positive integer)
    indicating the number of incidences of the phenomenon recorded at that point.

        <Options>Collapse In Pixel : All field data points falling within a single pixel will be collapse into a single point at the center of that pixel.  If using Presense(Absense) data the point will be given a value of 1 if any are presense, otherwise 0 if any are absense, otherwise -9999 if all are background.  If using count data the point value will be the sum of all points in a pixel.
    Weight Per Pixel : All field data points are retained but a weight column is added and points in pixels with multiple points are given a weight of 1 over the number of points in that pixel.  For example all the points in a pixel with 4 points would be given a weight of 1/4.
    Inverse Density : Sets point weights inversely proportional to their spatial proximity to other points using an isotropic Gaussian smoothing kernel to calculate the density using the density.ppp function in the spatstat library in R using the leaveoneout=TRUE option which calculates the density at each point ignoring the point itself so that a completely isolated point will have weight equal to 1.  The standard deviation of the kernel is by default a function of the area of the minimum convex polygon containing all points.  This can optionally be set and explored by the user and an option is available to set this parameter to half the pixel length.  The density calculated for the points is multiplied by 2??2 to adjust for the height of the Gaussian.  Once the density is calculated, weights are set equal to  1/sqrt(1+density at the point).
    Total Presence = Total Absence :  Sets weights so the sum of the weights for presence points is equal to the sum of the weights for absence point by down-weighting absences.  Presence points will have weight 1. 

Note - that currently only GLM, MARS, and Boosted Regression Trees accept weights.  Any Weights column will be ignored by Random Forest and Maxent.  </Options>

    <Title>Predictor</Title>
    <Description>
    Predictor
    
    The Predictor module allows a user to select a single raster layer for consideration in the
    modeled analysis. Four parameters must be specified by the user:
    
    1. Aggregation Method: The aggregation method to be used in the event that the raster layer
    must be up-scaled to match the template layer (e.g., generalizing a 10 m input layer to a
    100 m output layer). Care should be taken to ensure that the aggregation method that
    best preserves the integrity of the data is used.
    
    2. Resample Method: The resample method employed to interpolate new cell values when
    transforming the raster layer to the coordinate space or cell size of the template layer,
    if necessary. 
    
    3. Categorical (Boolean): Checking this box indicates that the data contained in the raster
    layer is categorical (e.g. landcover categories). Leaving this box unchecked indicates that
    the data contained in the raster is continuous (e.g., a DEM layer). This distinction is important
    in determining an appropriate resampling method.
    
    4. File Path: The location of the raster predictor file, which a user can specify by navigating to the
    file's location on their file system. When a user is selecting an ESRI grid raster, the user should navigate
    to the 'hdr.adf' file contained within the grid folder. 
    
    Accepted formats include:
        ESRI Grid ('.bil', or the folder, or 'hdr.adf' file in the folder, see above)
        GeoTiffs('.tif')
        Imagine('.img')
        ASCII('.asc')
        Bitmap('.bmp')
        Jpeg('.jpg')
