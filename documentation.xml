    <Title>PARC</Title>
    <Description>The Projection, Aggregation, Resampling, and Clipping (PARC) module is a powerful utility that automates the preparation steps required for using raster layers in most geospatial modeling packages. In order to successfully consider multiple environmental predictors in raster format, each layer must have coincident cells (pixels) of the same size, have the same coordinate system (and projection, if applicable), and the same geographic extent. The PARC module ensures that all of these conditions are met for the input layers by transforming and or reprojecting each raster to match the coordinate system of the template layer. This process usually involves aggregation (necessary when an input raster layer must be up-scaled to match the template layer-- e.g., generalizing a 10 m input layer to a 100 m output layer), and or resampling (necessary for interpolating new cell values when transforming the raster layer to the coordinate space or cell size of the template layer). Lastly, each raster predictor layer is clipped to match the extent of the template layer.

The settings used during these processing steps follow a particular set of decision rules designed to preserve the integrity of data as much as possible. However, it is important for a user to understand how these processing steps may modify the data inputs. For additional information about the PARC module, please see the extended help and documentation for the SAHM package. </Description>

        <PortName>RastersWithPARCInfoCSV</PortName>
        <Definition>This is a CSV containing a list of files to include in the PARC operation.

The format of this list conforms to the 'PredictorListFile' specs:
    Column 1: The full file path to the input raster layer including the drive.
    Column 2: A binary value indicating whether the input layer is categorical or not. A value of "0" indicates that an input raster is non-categorical data (continuous), while a value of "1" indicates that an input raster is categorical data.
    Column 3: The resampling method employed to interpolate new cell values when transforming the raster layer to the coordinate space or cell size of the template layer, if necessary. The resampling type should be specified using one of the following values: "nearestneighbor," "bilinear," "cubic," or "lanczos."
    Column 4: The aggregation method to be used in the event that the raster layer must be up-scaled to match the template layer (e.g., generalizing a 10 m input layer to a 100 m output layer). Care should be taken to ensure that the aggregation method that best preserves the integrity of the data is used. The aggregation should be specified using one of the following values: "Min," "Mean," "Max," "Majority," or "None."

In formatting the list of predictor files, the titles assigned to each of the columns are unimportant as the module retrieves the information based on the order of the values in the .csv file (the ordering of the information and the permissible values in the file however, are strictly enforced). The module also anticipates a header row and will ignore the first row in the .csv file.</Definition>

    <Title>RasterFormatConverter</Title>
    <Description>The RasterFormatConverter module allows a user to easily convert between raster file types for a group of rasters. This group can be specified as either all the rasters in a single directory or the rasters specified in a single MDS file (see below).  All outputs will be sent to a folder named "ConvertedRasters" (followed by an underscore and a number corresponding to the run sequence of the module) within the user's current VisTrail's session folder.  Typically this module will be used within a workflow to convert the geotiff format used by the rest of the modules to the ascii format needed by Maxent.  But the following file formats are accepted for both inputs and outputs: Arc/Info ASCII Grid, ESRI BIL, ERDAS Imagine, and JPEG and others.

    <Title>BoostedRegressionTree</Title>
    <Description>BRT uses decision trees to partition the the parameter space into the most homogeneous groups in terms of the response.  BRT starts with a single decision tree, then adds a tree that best explains error in the first tree, and so on.  Like random forest, BRT models automatically model interactions and nonlinear relationships, and are robust to missing observations.  Our implementation makes approximately 1,000 trees.  It incorporates advanced algorithms for tuning the model settings, simplifying the model using a cross-validation technique, and for detecting important interactions between covariates.  If more than 500 presence or absence records are found a random subset will be used for learning rate estimation and model simplification but all data will be used in the final model fitting step.  The cross-validation step within BRT should not be confused with that provided by the Model Selection Cross Validation step.  The former is used to optimize parameter values when defaults are not provided while the later is used to select models based on between model comparisons of evaluation metrics.  All discussion of cross-validation related to setting parameters in the BRT argument documentation refers to the algorithm used for parameter optimization and does not affect the cross validation split selected by Model Selection and Cross Validation.  

Several options are available for fitting BRTs when run using VisTrails special attention is required before moving away from the defaults because selection of certain parameters will disallow selection of others.  Optional parameters are described briefly here but a more in depth description can be found in Elith and Leathwich 2008.</Description>

        <Definition>If specified using MakeProbabilityMap=True then a surface of predicted values is produced based on the tiffs in the input .mds file and the fitted model.  These can but do not always indicate the probability of finding the species at a given site.  For example if model calibration is poor then these will not agree well with the true probabilities though discrimination between presence and absences might still be good.

        <PortName>ResidualsMap</PortName>
        <Definition>Model residual plots show the spatial relationship between the model deviance residuals.  Most models assume residuals will be independent thus spatial pattern in the deviance residuals can be indicative of a problem with the model fit and inference based on the fit.  It can for example indicate that important predictors were not included in the model and can be compared with the spatial pattern of predictors that were not included in the model.  Whether or not a significant spatial pattern exists in model residuals can at times be difficult to assess visually.  We hope to add correlograms of Moran's I soon.  Unfortunately statistical tests based on the Moran's I statistic for residuals of binary response models lack statistical justification and thus cannot be used to test for a significant spatial pattern (Bivand 2008).   See Dormann 2007 for more discussion on evaluation of model residuals and spatial models that are appropriate for species distribution modeling.  Residual plots can also be used to determine if certain observations contribute disproportionately to the deviance of the fitted model.  For a binary response model deviance residuals with absolute values greater than 2 can be indicative of a problem.</Definition>

        <PortName>MessMap</PortName>
        <Definition>If specified by selecting makeMESMap=True the the MESS and MoD surfaces will be produced.  The MESS surface is the multivariate environment similarity surface and shows how well each point fits into the univariate ranges of the points for which the model was fit.  Negative values in this map indicate that the point is out of the range of the training data.  The MESS map takes the minimum value of a statistic calculate for each predictor and thus cannot diagnose hidden extrapolation as one might do using a hat matrix.  This surface is only calculated for variables that are selected in the model selection step within each model fitting algorithm so that variables that do not significantly affect the occurrence of the organism over the range of the training data will not be included in the MESS map even though these predictors might be influential to the organism outside the range in which the model was fit.  Random Forest never drops predictors so if one wishes to compare the MESS and MoD map before and after insignificant predictors were dropped, one can compare the MESS map of a Random Forest fit to that produced from the other model fit algorithms as long as they were fit using the same dataset.  See Elith et. al. 2010 for details on how the MESS map calculations are performed.</Definition>

        <PortName>modelEvalPlot</PortName>
        <Definition>For binary data this will be a Receiver operating characteristic curve.  Which shows the relationship between sensitivity and specificity as the threshold for discretizing continuous predictions into presence absence is varied.  The threshold selected using the specified ThresholdOptimizationMethod is shown.  If a model selection test\training split was specified the ROC curve for this will be shown in red and if a cross-validation split was specified ROC curves for each cross-validation fold will be overlayed with box plots summarizing cross-validation results.  If the model fits well both sensitivity and specificity should be well above the diagonal line.  If there is a strong disparity between the curves for the training data and either the testing split or cross validation standard deviation curves this can be indicative of model overfitting.  These plots and the evaluation metrics based on the confusion matrix describe the models ability to discriminate between presence and absence points.  The AUC value, or area under the ROC curve, is the probability that the model will rank a randomly chosen presence observation higher than a randomly chosen absence observation.  For count data this display will show several standard plots for assessment of model residuals.

        <Definition>This file contains a summary of  the model fit.  The information contained here includes the number of presence observations (counts equal to or greater than 1 for count models), the number of absence points, the number of covariates that were considered by the model selection algorithm.  Note all of these can differ from the numbers in the original .mds due to incomplete records being deleted, and predictors with only one unique value being removed.  The random number seed is recorded if applicable which allows completely reproducible results as well as a summary of the model fit.  Evaluation Statistics are reported for the data used to fit the model as well as for the test or cross-validation split if applicable.  References for how to interpret most of these are ubiquitous in the literature but it is worth mentioning that interpretation of the calibration statistics is described by Pearce and Ferrier 2000 as well as Miller and Hui 1991.  Most metrics reported here can also be found in related graphical displays.</Definition>

    <Title>ModelSelectionSplit</Title>
    <Description>
    The ModelSelectionSplit reserves a portion of the data from the model fitting 
process but reports the evaluation metrics on all models not just the those selected as the 
final models to be reported in the analysis (in contrast to the ModelEvaluationSplit).  This module 
can be placed either directly before or directly after the CovariateCorrelationAndSelection.  If both a 
ModelEvaluationSplit and a ModelSelectionSplit are specified then the training portion of the ModelEvalutationSplit will 
be further partitioned by the ModelSelectionSplit thus the ModelEvalutationSplit should come 
first in the workflow.  Both of these algorithms stratify the splits by the response.  
That is, the ratio of presence to absence points should be nearly equal in the testing 
and training split.  If a ModelSelectionSplit is included evaluation metrics applied to 
the reserved data will be reported in the textual output, model evaluation plots including 
AUC plots as well as the across model plots and the csv.  Both of these modules ignore 
background points and treat all observations with values greater than 0 as presence 
for the purpose of stratification by response. Three parameters can be set by the user for each of these modules:

       1.	Ratio of Presence/Absence Points: This optional field is populated with a number corresponding 
         to the desired ratio of presence to  absence points to be used in the analysis. If not populated 
         then all occurrence records (not background points) will be portioned into either the test or 
         training split with no reduction in the total number of points.  If populated, this entry should 
         be a number greater than zero. (A value of '1' will result in an equal number of both presence 
         and absence points being used, a value of '2' indicates that twice as many presence points 
         will be used, a value of '0.5' indicates that twice as many absence points will be used, etc.). 
         All field data points with a value equal to or greater than 1 are interpreted as presence points. 
         Although the original field data is unmodified, this option will reduce the sample size as the 
         merged dataset containing sample points will have points deleted from it to achieve the 
         specified ratio as such it should be used with caution. A warning will be generated if 
         more than 50% of either the presence or absence points will be deleted based on the ratio 
         specified by the user. Background points are ignored by this module (they are read in 
         and written out, but not assigned to either the test or training split).
		
         2.	Input Merged Data Set (MDS): This is the input data set consisting of location data for each sample 
         point, the values of each predictor variable at those points, and if established, a field denoting the 
         weight that will be assigned to each point in modeling. This input is usually provided by the upstream 
         steps that precede the Test Training Split module. Any value entered here (e.g., specifying another 
         existing MDS on the file system) will override the input specified by a model connection in the visual display.

         3.	 Training Proportion: This is the proportion of the sample points that will be used to train the model, 
         relative to the total number of points. Entered values should be greater than 0 but less than 1. For example, 
         a value of '0.9' will result in 90% of the sample points being used to train the model, with 10% of the sample 
         being held out to test the model's performance. Choosing an appropriate training proportion can depend on various 
         factors, such as the total number of sample points available.  Selecting an appropriate value for the training 
         proportion is a complex issue that depends on many factors including the total number of observations, the 
         complexity of the models that will be fit, and the signal to noise ratio in the data (Hastie et. al. 2009). 
		
    It is not valid to select models based on their performance on the reserved portion of the data and then report these 
metrics only for the top performing models claiming that we would expect similar performance on an independent dataset see Hastie 2009 for 
this discussion.  If one desires metrics for how the models might be expected to perform on an independent dataset then the ModelEvaluationSplit 
must be used.

    <Title>MDSBuilder</Title>
    <Description>The Merged Data Set (MDS) Builder module is a utility that extracts the values of each predictor layer to the point locations included in the field data set. The module produces a .csv file that contains the x and y locations of the sample points and a column indicating whether each point represents a presence recording, an absence recording, a presence count, or a background point.  Following these first three columns, each environmental predictor layer is appended as a column with row entries representing the value present in the raster layer at each field sample point.  There are a total of three header rows in the output .csv of the MDSBuilder. The first row contains the columns "x," "y," "ResponseBinary" or "ResponseCount," and the names of each of the raster predictor files that were passed to the MDS Builder. The second row contains a binary value indicating whether the column should be included when the model is finally applied; these values are later modified during the Covariate Correlation and Selection process that takes place downstream in the workflow. The final header row contains the full path on the file system to each of the raster predictor files.

The output from this module is in the format expected by most of the pre-modeling data manipulation modules, all of the model modules, as well as the RasterFormatConverter module.  As such it can reasonabily be connected to numerous other modules depending on the type of modeling being conducted.  A typical workflow would linearly connect MDSBuilder -&gt; ModleEvaluationSplit -&gt; ModelSelectionSplit or ModelSelectionCrossValidation -&gt; CovariateCorrelationAndSelection -&gt; any or all of the models (BoostedRegressionTree, GLM, MARS, RandomForest, Maxent).  If using Maxent the output from CovariateCorrelationAndSelection would also go into the RasterFormatConverter module which woulc connect to the projectionlayers of the maxent module.</Description>

        <Definition>Background Probability Surface: This is an optional parameter that applies only to workflows that employ the Maxent modeling package. In some analyses, it may be appropriate to spatially limit background points to a particular subset of the study area (e.g., islands within a study area polygon, particular regions within a study area polygon, or a region determined by the known bias present in the field data).  Specifying a background probability surface raster allows a user to control where random points will be scattered within the extent of the study area. The raster layer specified by a user should have the same projection and extent as the template layer and contain values ranging from 0 to 100. These values represent the probability that a randomly generated point will be retained should it fall within a particular cell.  That is, randomly generated points will not be generated in any part of the probability grid with a value of "0" while all points falling in an area with a value of "100" will be retained. A point falling in an area with a value of "50" will be kept as a background point 50% of the time.</Definition>

    <Title>FieldDataQuery</Title>
    <Description>Often raw field data come to us in a format that contains more information than we need to include in any single model.  This can take the form of additional columns that contain extraneous information, additional columns that contain occurrence data for additional species, or rows that from a time period, collection method, or species that we are not interested in modeling.  The Field Data Query module contains functionality to subset and reformat this output into the format used by the SAHM package.  
    Columns can be specified with either a positional argument (1, 2, 3, etc) if you want to select the first, second, third etc column.  Note these numbers start from 1.  Alternatively you can select a column based on name by entering the text of the column name found in the header.

    When selecting rows there are two types of queries that can be specified:
       Simple - Select a Query_Column and enter a value in the Query port.  If the value for a row in the selected column equals the value entered in the Query that row will be kept.  For example you might have a 'year' column and you would want to select all 2009 entries.  NOTE:  DO NOT ENCLOSE THE QUERY TEXT IN QUOTES IF YOU ARE TRYING TO MATCH A STRING!

       Complex - Optionally you can construct complex queries using Python syntax.  To do this enclose the column name in square brackets as part of a line of Python code.  Since the columns used are specified in the query string there is no need to use the Query_column port and it will be ignored.  For example to select years greater than 2005 you would use:  [year] &gt; 2005  To include string equality make sure you enclose the entire bracketed field name in quotes as well.  For example "[Observer]" == "Colin"  Complex queries involving multiple columns are possible as well, for example "[Observer]" != "Colin" and [year] &gt; 2005.</Description>

        <Definition>Model residual plots show the spatial relationship between the model deviance residuals.  Most models assume residuals will be independent thus spatial pattern in the deviance residuals can be indicative of a problem with the model fit and inference based on the fit.  It can for example indicate that important predictors were not included in the model and can be compared with the spatial pattern of predictors that were not included in the model.  Whether or not a significant spatial pattern exists in model residuals can at times be difficult to assess visually.  We hope to add correlograms of Moran's I soon.  Unfortunately statistical tests based on the Moran's I statistic for residuals of binary response models lack statistical justification and thus cannot be used to test for a significant spatial pattern (Bivand 2008).   See Dormann 2007 for more discussion on evaluation of model residuals and spatial models that are appropriate for species distribution modeling.  Residual plots can also be used to determine if certain observations contribute disproportionately to the deviance of the fitted model.  For a binary response model deviance residuals with absolute values greater than 2 can be indicative of a problem.</Definition>

        <PortName>MessMap</PortName>
        <Definition>If specified by selecting makeMESMap=True the the MESS and MoD surfaces will be produced.  The MESS surface is the multivariate environment similarity surface and shows how well each point fits into the univariate ranges of the points for which the model was fit.  Negative values in this map indicate that the point is out of the range of the training data.  The MESS map takes the minimum value of a statistic calculate for each predictor and thus cannot diagnose hidden extrapolation as one might do using a hat matrix.  This surface is only calculated for variables that are selected in the model selection step within each model fitting algorithm so that variables that do not significantly affect the occurrence of the organism over the range of the training data will not be included in the MESS map even though these predictors might be influential to the organism outside the range in which the model was fit.  Random Forest never drops predictors so if one wishes to compare the MESS and MoD map before and after insignificant predictors were dropped, one can compare the MESS map of a Random Forest fit to that produced from the other model fit algorithms as long as they were fit using the same dataset.  See Elith et. al. 2010 for details on how the MESS map calculations are performed.</Definition>

        <Definition>For binary data this will be a Receiver operating characteristic curve.  Which shows the relationship between sensitivity and specificity as the threshold for discretizing continuous predictions into presence absence is varied.  The threshold selected using the specified ThresholdOptimizationMethod is shown.  If a model selection test\training split was specified the ROC curve for this will be shown in red and if a cross-validation split was specified ROC curves for each cross-validation fold will be overlayed with box plots summarizing cross-validation results.  If the model fits well both sensitivity and specificity should be well above the diagonal line.  If there is a strong disparity between the curves for the training data and either the testing split or cross validation standard deviation curves this can be indicative of model overfitting.  These plots and the evaluation metrics based on the confusion matrix describe the models ability to discriminate between presence and absence points.  The AUC value, or area under the ROC curve, is the probability that the model will rank a randomly chosen presence observation higher than a randomly chosen absence observation.  For count data this display will show several standard plots for assessment of model residuals.

        <Definition>This file contains a summary of  the model fit.  The information contained here includes the number of presence observations (counts equal to or greater than 1 for count models), the number of absence points, the number of covariates that were considered by the model selection algorithm.  Note all of these can differ from the numbers in the original .mds due to incomplete records being deleted, and predictors with only one unique value being removed.  The random number seed is recorded if applicable which allows completely reproducible results as well as a summary of the model fit.  Evaluation Statistics are reported for the data used to fit the model as well as for the test or cross-validation split if applicable.  References for how to interpret most of these are ubiquitous in the literature but it is worth mentioning that interpretation of the calibration statistics is described by Pearce and Ferrier 2000 as well as Miller and Hui 1991.  Most metrics reported here can also be found in related graphical displays.</Definition>

    <Title>ModelEvaluationSplit</Title>
    <Description>
     The ModelEvaluationSplit module provides the opportunity to reserve a specified portion of the data for 
    producing and reporting evaluation metrics on an independent test set following model exploration and selection.  
    The ModelEvaluationSplit must be applied before the CovariateCorrelationAndSelection module.  
    The nearly identical ModelSelectionSplit reserves a portion of the data from the model fitting 
    process but reports the evaluation metrics on all models not just the those selected as the 
    final models to be reported in the analysis.  This module can be placed either directly before 
    or directly after the CovariateCorrelationAndSelection.  If both a ModelEvaluationSplit and a 
    ModelSelectionSplit are specified then the training portion of the ModelEvalutationSplit will 
    be further partitioned by the ModelSelectionSplit thus the ModelEvalutationSplit should come 
    first in the workflow.  Both of these algorithms stratify the splits by the response.  
    That is, the ratio of presence to absence points should be nearly equal in the testing 
    and training split.  If a ModelSelectionSplit is included evaluation metrics applied to 
    the reserved data will be reported in the textual output, model evaluation plots including 
    AUC plots as well as the across model plots and the csv.  Both of these modules ignore 
    background points and treat all observations with values greater than 0 as presence 
    for the purpose of stratification by response. Three parameters can be set by the user for each of these modules: 

		1.	Ratio of Presence/Absence Points: This optional field is populated with a number corresponding 
		to the desired ratio of presence to  absence points to be used in the analysis. If not populated 
		then all occurrence records (not background points) will be portioned into either the test or 
		training split with no reduction in the total number of points.  If populated, this entry should 
		be a number greater than zero. (A value of '1' will result in an equal number of both presence 
		and absence points being used, a value of '2' indicates that twice as many presence points 
		will be used, a value of '0.5' indicates that twice as many absence points will be used, etc.). 
		All field data points with a value equal to or greater than 1 are interpreted as presence points. 
		Although the original field data is unmodified, this option will reduce the sample size as the 
		merged dataset containing sample points will have points deleted from it to achieve the 
		specified ratio as such it should be used with caution. A warning will be generated if 
		more than 50% of either the presence or absence points will be deleted based on the ratio 
		specified by the user. Background points are ignored by this module (they are read in 
		and written out, but not assigned to either the test or training split).
		
		2.	Input Merged Data Set (MDS): This is the input data set consisting of location data for each sample 
	    point, the values of each predictor variable at those points, and if established, a field denoting the 
	    weight that will be assigned to each point in modeling. This input is usually provided by the upstream 
	    steps that precede the Test Training Split module. Any value entered here (e.g., specifying another 
	    existing MDS on the file system) will override the input specified by a model connection in the visual display.

		3.	 Training Proportion: This is the proportion of the sample points that will be used to train the model, 
		relative to the total number of points. Entered values should be greater than 0 but less than 1. For example, 
		a value of '0.9' will result in 90% of the sample points being used to train the model, with 10% of the sample 
		being held out to test the model's performance. Choosing an appropriate training proportion can depend on various 
		factors, such as the total number of sample points available.  Selecting an appropriate value for the training 
		proportion is a complex issue that depends on many factors including the total number of observations, the 
		complexity of the models that will be fit, and the signal to noise ratio in the data (Hastie et. al. 2009).

    <Title>GLM</Title>
    <Description>This is basically linear regression adapted to binary presence-absence or count data.  We used a bidirectional stepwise procedure to select covariates to be used in the model.  That is, we began with a null model and calculated the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) score for each covariate which could be added to the model.  AIC is a measure of how well the model fits the data with a penalty based on the number of covariates in the model.  In the first step, we add the covariate with the best AIC score.  In the next step we calculate AIC scores for all two-covariate models and again add the covariate that most improves the AIC, and so on.  At each step, we also look at the change in AIC from dropping each covariate currently in the model.  The stepwise procedure ends when no additions or removals result in an improvement in AIC.

        <PortName>ResidualsMap</PortName>
        <Definition>Model residual plots show the spatial relationship between the model deviance residuals.  Most models assume residuals will be independent thus spatial pattern in the deviance residuals can be indicative of a problem with the model fit and inference based on the fit.  It can for example indicate that important predictors were not included in the model and can be compared with the spatial pattern of predictors that were not included in the model.  Whether or not a significant spatial pattern exists in model residuals can at times be difficult to assess visually.  We hope to add correlograms of Moran's I soon.  Unfortunately statistical tests based on the Moran's I statistic for residuals of binary response models lack statistical justification and thus cannot be used to test for a significant spatial pattern (Bivand 2008).   See Dormann 2007 for more discussion on evaluation of model residuals and spatial models that are appropriate for species distribution modeling.  Residual plots can also be used to determine if certain observations contribute disproportionately to the deviance of the fitted model.  For a binary response model deviance residuals with absolute values greater than 2 can be indicative of a problem.</Definition>

        <PortName>MessMap</PortName>
        <Definition>If specified by selecting makeMESMap=True the the MESS and MoD surfaces will be produced.  The MESS surface is the multivariate environment similarity surface and shows how well each point fits into the univariate ranges of the points for which the model was fit.  Negative values in this map indicate that the point is out of the range of the training data.  The MESS map takes the minimum value of a statistic calculate for each predictor and thus cannot diagnose hidden extrapolation as one might do using a hat matrix.  This surface is only calculated for variables that are selected in the model selection step within each model fitting algorithm so that variables that do not significantly affect the occurrence of the organism over the range of the training data will not be included in the MESS map even though these predictors might be influential to the organism outside the range in which the model was fit.  Random Forest never drops predictors so if one wishes to compare the MESS and MoD map before and after insignificant predictors were dropped, one can compare the MESS map of a Random Forest fit to that produced from the other model fit algorithms as long as they were fit using the same dataset.  See Elith et. al. 2010 for details on how the MESS map calculations are performed.</Definition>

        <Definition>For binary data this will be a Receiver operating characteristic curve.  Which shows the relationship between sensitivity and specificity as the threshold for discretizing continuous predictions into presence absence is varied.  The threshold selected using the specified ThresholdOptimizationMethod is shown.  If a model selection test\training split was specified the ROC curve for this will be shown in red and if a cross-validation split was specified ROC curves for each cross-validation fold will be overlayed with box plots summarizing cross-validation results.  If the model fits well both sensitivity and specificity should be well above the diagonal line.  If there is a strong disparity between the curves for the training data and either the testing split or cross validation standard deviation curves this can be indicative of model overfitting.  These plots and the evaluation metrics based on the confusion matrix describe the models ability to discriminate between presence and absence points.  The AUC value, or area under the ROC curve, is the probability that the model will rank a randomly chosen presence observation higher than a randomly chosen absence observation.  For count data this display will show several standard plots for assessment of model residuals.

The information contained here includes the number of presence observations (counts equal to or greater than 1 for count models), the number of absence points, the number of covariates that were considered by the model selection algorithm.  Note all of these can differ from the numbers in the original .mds due to incomplete records being deleted, and predictors with only one unique value being removed.  The random number seed is recorded if applicable which allows completely reproducible results as well as a summary of the model fit.  Evaluation Statistics are reported for the data used to fit the model as well as for the test or cross-validation split if applicable.  References for how to interpret most of these are ubiquitous in the literature but it is worth mentioning that interpretation of the calibration statistics is described by Pearce and Ferrier 2000 as well as Miller and Hui 1991.  Most metrics reported here can also be found in related graphical displays.</Definition>

    <Title>ModelSelectionCrossValidation</Title>
    <Description>The ModelSelectionCrossValidation module provides another tool for model selection by splitting the field data observations into cross validation folds.  This should not be used with the ModelSelectionSplit but can be used with the ModelEvaluationSplit in which case only the training portion of the ModelEvalutationSplit is partitioned into folds.  If specified then the individual models will fit a model using all of the data and report this as the training results.  Following the model fitting step sub-models with be fit to each set of n-1 folds and then evaluation metrics calculated on the remaining fold.  These will show up as ranges in the AUC plot, means and standard deviations are reported in textual output and box plots in across model comparison plots.  Evaluation metrics for each individual fold are reported in the across model comparison csv.  The cross validation method incorporated here was originally written for evaluation of MARS models by Leathwick et. al. 2006.  The current implementation does not attempt any sort of model averaging but rather is only used for calculation of evaluation metrics.  The ModelSelectionCrossValidation module makes better use of data then the ModelSelectionSplit as it uses all of the data to fit the final model but can be substantially more time consuming.
   
Under most circumstances the cross validation evaluation metrics reported by this module do not indicate how the the model might perform if applied to an independent set of data but rather are to be used only for model selection purposes.  The first issue is that when cross validation is applied any feature selection based on the relationship between the response and the predictors must be carried out on each cross validation training set.  The CovariateCorrelationAndSelection module includes an exploration of the relationship between the predictors and the response and thus would need to be carried out for each for each cross validation training set.  The second issue is that it is invalid to use an evaluation metric for model selection and then report that metric for only the best performing model without acknowledgement to the total number of models that were considered and the range of the evaluation metrics.  This module ignores background points.

    <Title>PredictorListFile</Title>
    <Description>The PredictorListFile module allows a user to load a .csv file containing a list of rasters for consideration in the modeled analysis. The .csv file should contain a header row and four columns containing the following information, in order, for each raster input. 

Column 1: The full file path to the input raster layer.
    
Column 2: A binary value indicating whether the input layer is categorical or not.  A value of "0" indicates that an input raster is non-categorical data (continuous), while a value of "1" indicates that an input raster is categorical data.
    
Column 3: The resampling method employed to interpolate new cell values when transforming the raster layer to the coordinate space or cell size of the template layer, if necessary. The resampling type should be specified using one of the following values: "nearestneighbor," "bilinear," "cubic," or "lanczos."
    
Column 4: The aggregation method to be used in the event that the raster layer must be up-scaled to match the template layer (e.g., generalizing a 10 m input layer to a 100 m output layer). Care should be taken to ensure that the aggregation method that best preserves the integrity of the data is used. The aggregation should be specified using one of the following values: "Min," "Mean," "Max," "Majority," or "None."

In formatting the list of predictor files, the titles assigned to each of the columns are unimportant as the module retrieves the information based on the order of the values in the .csv file (the ordering of the information and the permissible values in the file however, are strictly enforced). The module also anticipates a header row and will ignore the first row in the .csv file.

    <Title>MARS</Title>
    <Description>MARS is a non-parametric technique that builds flexible models by fitting piecewise logistic regressions.  In effect, it is similar to GLM except that rather than fitting a straight line response to each predictor, piecewise functions of each predictor are fit, which allows MARS to better accommodate nonlinear response to predictors and also reduces the risk that outlying observations might have high leverage.  The model is deliberately over-fit and then pruned back.  The original code was developed from that provided in the supporting material of Leathwick and Elith 2006 which contains more details on how model fitting occurs.</Description>

        <PortName>ResidualsMap</PortName>
        <Definition>Model residual plots show the spatial relationship between the model deviance residuals.  Most models assume residuals will be independent thus spatial pattern in the deviance residuals can be indicative of a problem with the model fit and inference based on the fit.  It can for example indicate that important predictors were not included in the model and can be compared with the spatial pattern of predictors that were not included in the model.  Whether or not a significant spatial pattern exists in model residuals can at times be difficult to assess visually.  We hope to add correlograms of Moran's I soon.  Unfortunately statistical tests based on the Moran's I statistic for residuals of binary response models lack statistical justification and thus cannot be used to test for a significant spatial pattern (Bivand 2008).   See Dormann 2007 for more discussion on evaluation of model residuals and spatial models that are appropriate for species distribution modeling.  Residual plots can also be used to determine if certain observations contribute disproportionately to the deviance of the fitted model.  For a binary response model deviance residuals with absolute values greater than 2 can be indicative of a problem.</Definition>

        <PortName>MessMap</PortName>
        <Definition>If specified by selecting makeMESMap=True the the MESS and MoD surfaces will be produced.  The MESS surface is the multivariate environment similarity surface and shows how well each point fits into the univariate ranges of the points for which the model was fit.  Negative values in this map indicate that the point is out of the range of the training data.  The MESS map takes the minimum value of a statistic calculate for each predictor and thus cannot diagnose hidden extrapolation as one might do using a hat matrix.  This surface is only calculated for variables that are selected in the model selection step within each model fitting algorithm so that variables that do not significantly affect the occurrence of the organism over the range of the training data will not be included in the MESS map even though these predictors might be influential to the organism outside the range in which the model was fit.  Random Forest never drops predictors so if one wishes to compare the MESS and MoD map before and after insignificant predictors were dropped, one can compare the MESS map of a Random Forest fit to that produced from the other model fit algorithms as long as they were fit using the same dataset.  See Elith et. al. 2010 for details on how the MESS map calculations are performed.</Definition>

        <Definition>For binary data this will be a Receiver operating characteristic curve.  Which shows the relationship between sensitivity and specificity as the threshold for discretizing continuous predictions into presence absence is varied.  The threshold selected using the specified ThresholdOptimizationMethod is shown.  If a model selection test\training split was specified the ROC curve for this will be shown in red and if a cross-validation split was specified ROC curves for each cross-validation fold will be overlayed with box plots summarizing cross-validation results.  If the model fits well both sensitivity and specificity should be well above the diagonal line.  If there is a strong disparity between the curves for the training data and either the testing split or cross validation standard deviation curves this can be indicative of model overfitting.  These plots and the evaluation metrics based on the confusion matrix describe the models ability to discriminate between presence and absence points.  The AUC value, or area under the ROC curve, is the probability that the model will rank a randomly chosen presence observation higher than a randomly chosen absence observation.  For count data this display will show several standard plots for assessment of model residuals.

        <Definition>This file contains a summary of  the model fit.  The information contained here includes the number of presence observations (counts equal to or greater than 1 for count models), the number of absence points, the number of covariates that were considered by the model selection algorithm.  Note all of these can differ from the numbers in the original .mds due to incomplete records being deleted, and predictors with only one unique value being removed.  The random number seed is recorded if applicable which allows completely reproducible results as well as a summary of the model fit.  Evaluation Statistics are reported for the data used to fit the model as well as for the test or cross-validation split if applicable.  References for how to interpret most of these are ubiquitous in the literature but it is worth mentioning that interpretation of the calibration statistics is described by Pearce and Ferrier 2000 as well as Miller and Hui 1991.  Most metrics reported here can also be found in related graphical displays.</Definition>

    <Title>TemplateLayer</Title>
    <Description>The second fundamental input in an analysis is the template layer.  It is used to define the extent and resolution that will be used in all subsequent analyses.  The TemplateLayer is a raster data layer with a defined coordinate system, a known cell size, and an extent that defines the study area. The data type and values in this raster are not important.  All additional raster layers used in the analysis will be resampled and reprojected as needed to match the template, snapped to the template, and clipped to have an extent that matches the template. Users should ensure that additional covariates considered in the analysis have complete coverage of the template layer used.</Description>

    <Title>CovariateCorrelationAndSelection</Title>
    <Description>The CovariateCorrelationAndSelection view provides a breakpoint in the modeling workflow for the user to assess how well each variable explains the distribution of the sampled data points and to remove any variables that may exhibit high correlation with others. 
The display shows the n variables that have the highest total number of correlations above a threshold with other predictors using the maximum of the Pearson, Spearman and Kendall coefficient. The column heading over each variable displays the number of other variables with which the environmental predictor is correlated using the user supplied threshold which defaults to .7.  Radio buttons are available to limit the display and correlation calculations to any combination of presence, absence, or background points.  The first column in the plot shows the relationship between the response and each predictor.  Row labels indicate the maximum of the Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficient and a locally weighted smooth has been added to help distinguish the nature of the relationship.  
The remaining plots make up a square with histograms for each variable displayed on the diagonal.  Their respective graphical display and correlation with other variables can be found by locating the row/column intersection between each (above and below the diagonal).  The scatter plot along with a locally weight smooth is shown below the diagonal.  Presence records are represented by red points, absence by green, and background are yellow.  Above the diagonal is the correlation coefficient between the two predictors.  If Spearman or Kendall correlation coefficient is larger than the Pearson correlation coefficient then an s or k will show up in the bottom right corner of this box.   
 
A user is provided with the opportunity to select a new set of the environmental predictor variables and “Update” the Covariate Correlation screen to investigate the relationships among the new variables selected.  Variables with a high degree of correlation with other variables should generally be unchecked in their respective radio buttons, and will be excluded from subsequent analysis steps in the model workflow.
Multiple iterations can be run at this screen, allowing the user to investigate the relationships among the environmental predictor variables and choose the most appropriate set to be used in the subsequent modeling. When the desired set of variables has been chosen, the “OK” button is selected and processing will resume in the VisTrails workflow.

    <Title>FieldData</Title>
    <Description>The FieldData module allows a user to add presence/absence points or count data recorded across a landscape for the phenomenon being modeled (e.g., plant sightings, evidence of animal presence, etc.).  The input data for this module must be in the form of a .csv file that follows one of two formats: 

Format 1:
A .csv file with the following column headings, in order: "X," "Y," and "responseBinary".  In this case, the "X" field should be populated with the horizontal (longitudinal) positional data for a sample point. The "Y" field should be populated with the vertical (latitudinal) data for a sample point. These values must be in the same coordinate system/units as the template layer used in the workflow. The column "responseBinary" should be populated with either a '0' (indicating absence at the point) or a '1' (indicating presence at the point).

Format 2:
A .csv file with the following column headings, in order: "X," "Y," and "responseCount".  In this case, the "X" field should be populated with the horizontal (longitudinal) positional data for a sample point. The "Y" field should be populated with the vertical (latitudinal) data for a sample point. These values must be in the same coordinate system/units as the template layer used in the workflow. The column "responseCount" should be populated with either a '-9999' (indicating that the point is a background point) or a numerical value (either '0' or a positive integer) indicating the number of incidences of the phenomenon recorded at that point.     </Description>

    <Title>FieldDataAggregateAndWeight</Title>
    <Description>In many instances data collected in the field can be at a different spatial resolution than we are modeling at.  For example we might have observations collected every five meters along a 200 m. transect when we are modeling with covariates with 1000 m. cells.  When running species distribution models (SDMs) such as those contained in SAHM, spatial issues need to be addressed in order to avoid introduction of pseudo-replication.   For instance, considering multiple field data observations which are all spatially located in the same modeled pixel will generate replicate values or redundant information.  When running a model, this redundancy causes pseudo-replication and can negatively influence model development.  The FieldDataAggregateAndWeight tool helps aggregate field data locations so only one field data observation is represented per pixel or multiple points are downweighted proportionately.
  
Currently only GLM, MARS, and Boosted Regression Trees accept weights.  Any Weights column will be ignored by Random Forest.

      <Port>
        <PortName>categorical</PortName>
        <Definition>This paramater allows a user to indicate the type of data represented.  The distinction between continuous and categorical data will maintained throught a workflow by appending the word '_categorical' to categorical layer names in the resulting MDS file.  It is also import to select the nearest neighbor resampling option for categorical layers.</Definition>
