FieldDataQuery,fieldData,out,TRUE,NA,NA, The output from this port generally connnects to one of two modules/ports\n    1) FieldDataAggregateAndWeight FieldData - For collapsing or weighting points relative to the template pixels\n    2) MDS_builder - fieldData - for modeling without using the FieldDataAggregateAndWeight functionality.,"The file containing field data.

FieldDataAggregateAndWeight,PointAggregationOrWeightMethod,in,TRUE,Collapse In Pixel,"Collapse In Pixel : All field data points falling within a single pixel will be collapse into a single point at the center of that pixel.  If using Presense(Absense) data the point will be given a value of 1 if any are presense, otherwise 0 if any are absense, otherwise -9999 if all are background.  If using count data the point value will be the sum of all points in a pixel.
    Weight Per Pixel : All field data points are retained but a weight column is added and points in pixels with multiple points are given a weight of 1 over the number of points in that pixel.  For example all the points in a pixel with 4 points would be given a weight of 1/4.
    Inverse Density : Sets point weights inversely proportional to their spatial proximity to other points using an isotropic Gaussian smoothing kernel to calculate the density using the density.ppp function in the spatstat library in R using the leaveoneout=TRUE option which calculates the density at each point ignoring the point itself so that a completely isolated point will have weight equal to 1.  The standard deviation of the kernel is by default a function of the area of the minimum convex polygon containing all points.  This can optionally be set and explored by the user and an option is available to set this parameter to half the pixel length.  The density calculated for the points is multiplied by 2??2 to adjust for the height of the Gaussian.  Once the density is calculated, weights are set equal to  1/sqrt(1+density at the point).
    Total Presence = Total Absence :  Sets weights so the sum of the weights for presence points is equal to the sum of the weights for absence point by down-weighting absences.  Presence points will have weight 1. 

Note - that currently only GLM, MARS, and Boosted Regression Trees accept weights.  Any Weights column will be ignored by Random Forest and Maxent.  ",Does not generally Connect to any other Module.,The method used to either weight or aggregate field data points.
