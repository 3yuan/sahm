If using count data the point value will be the sum of all points in a pixel.
    Weight Per Pixel : All field data points are retained but a weight column is added and points in pixels with multiple points are given a weight of 1 over the number of points in that pixel.  For example all the points in a pixel with 4 points would be given a weight of 1/4.
    Inverse Density : Sets point weights inversely proportional to their spatial proximity to other points using an isotropic Gaussian smoothing kernel to calculate the density using the density.ppp function in the spatstat library in R using the leaveoneout=TRUE option which calculates the density at each point ignoring the point itself so that a completely isolated point will have weight equal to 1.  The standard deviation of the kernel is by default a function of the area of the minimum convex polygon containing all points.  This can optionally be set and explored by the user and an option is available to set this parameter to half the pixel length.  The density calculated for the points is multiplied by 2??2 to adjust for the height of the Gaussian.  Once the density is calculated, weights are set equal to  1/sqrt(1+density at the point).

The MESS surface is the multivariate environment similarity surface and shows how well each point fits into the univariate ranges of the points for which the model was fit.  Negative values in this map indicate that the point is out of the range of the training data.  The MoD map is related and indicates which variable was furthest from the range over which the model was.  The MESS map takes the minimum value of a statistic calculate for each predictor and thus cannot diagnose hidden extrapolation as one might do using a hat matrix.

Random Forest never drops predictors so if one wishes to compare the MESS and Mod map before and after insignificant predictors were dropped, one can compare the MESS map of a Random Forest fit to that produced from the other model fit algorithms as long as they were fit using the same dataset.  See Elith et. al. 2010 for details on how the MESS map calculations are performed."

BoostedRegressionTree,ProbablityMap,out,NA,NA,NA,Does not connect to any other module., If specified using MakeProbabilityMap=TRUE then a surface of predicted values is produced based on the tiffs in the input .mds file and the fitted model.  These can but do not always indicate the probability of finding the species at a given site.  For example if model calibration is poor then these will not agree well with the true probabilities though discrimination between presence and absences might still be good.
BoostedRegressionTree,ResidualsMap,out,NA,NA,NA,Does not connect to any other module.,Model residual plots show the spatial relationship between the model deviance residuals.  Most models assume residuals will be independent thus spatial pattern in the deviance residuals can be indicative of a problem with the model fit and inference based on the fit.  It can for example indicate that important predictors were not included in the model and can be compared with the spatial pattern of predictors that were not included in the model.  Whether or not a significant spatial pattern exists in model residuals can at times be difficult to assess visually.  We hope to add correlograms of Moran’s I soon.  Unfortunately statistical tests based on the Moran’s I statistic for residuals of binary response models lack statistical justification and thus cannot be used to test for a significant spatial pattern (Bivand 2008).   See Dormann 2007 for more discussion on evaluation of model residuals and spatial models that are appropriate for species distribution modeling.  Residual plots can also be used to determine if certain observations contribute disproportionately to the deviance of the fitted model.  For a binary response model deviance residuals with absolute values greater than 2 can be indicative of a problem.

The information contained here includes the number of presence observations (counts equal to or greater than 1 for count models), the number of absence points, the number of covariates that were considered by the model selection algorithm.  Note all of these can differ from the numbers in the original .mds due to incomplete records being deleted, and predictors with only one unique value being removed.  The random number seed is recorded if applicable which allows completely reproducible results as well as a summary of the model fit.  Evaluation Statistics are reported for the data used to fit the model as well as for the test or cross-validation split if applicable.  References for how to interpret most of these are ubiquitous in the literature but it is worth mentioning that interpretation of the calibration statistics is described by Pearce and Ferrier 2000 as well as Miller and Hui 1991.

If a model selection test\training split was specified the ROC curve for this will be shown in red and if a cross validation split was specified a blue region will show the standard deviation for the cross validation folds.  If the model fits well both sensitivity and specificity should be well above the diagonal line.  If there is a strong disparity between the curves for the training data and either the testing split or cross validation standard deviation curves this can be indicative of model overfitting.  These plots and the evaluation metrics based on the confusion matrix describe the models ability to discriminate between presence and absence points.  The AUC value, or area under the ROC curve, is the probability that the model will rank a randomly chosen presence observation higher than a randomly chosen absence observation.

Residual plots can also be used to determine if certain observations contribute disproportionately to the deviance of the fitted model.  For a binary response model deviance residuals with absolute values greater than 2 can be indicative of a problem.
