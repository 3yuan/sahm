PARC

Description:
        The Projection, Aggregation, Resampling, and Clipping (PARC) module is a powerful utility
    that automates the preparation steps required for using raster layers in most geospatial
    modeling packages. In order to successfully consider multiple environmental predictors in raster
    format, each layer must have coincident cells (pixels) of the same size, have the same
    coordinate system (and projection, if applicable), and the same geographic extent. The PARC
    module ensures that all of these conditions are met for the input layers by transforming and or
    reprojecting each raster to match the coordinate system of the template layer. This process
    usually involves aggregation (necessary when an input raster layer must be up-scaled to match
    the template layer-- e.g., generalizing a 10 m input layer to a 100 m output layer), and or
    resampling (necessary for interpolating new cell values when transforming the raster layer to
    the coordinate space or cell size of the template layer). Lastly, each raster predictor layer is
    clipped to match the extent of the template layer.

        The settings used during these processing steps follow a particular set of decision rules
    designed to preserve the integrity of data as much as possible. However, it is important for a
    user to understand how these processing steps may modify the data inputs. For additional
    information about the PARC module, please see the extended help and documentation for the SAHM
    package.

Input Ports:
    predictor:  (optional)
        A single raster with resampling, aggregation, and categorical options.
        Common connections:
            value' port of a Predictor module
            Note - Multiple single Predictor modules can be connected to this single input port.

    PredictorList:  (optional)
        This is an in memory data construct that contains a list of predictors each with resampling,
        aggregation, and categorical options.
        Common connections:
            value' port of any of the 'Individual Predictors selector' modules
            Note - Multiple single Predictors selectors modules can be connected to this single
                    input port.

    RastersWithPARCInfoCSV:  (optional)
        This is a CSV containing a list of files to include in the PARC operation.

        The format of this list conforms to the 'PredictorListFile' specs:
            Column 1: The full file path to the input raster layer including the drive.
            Column 2: A binary value indicating whether the input layer is categorical or not. A
        value of "0" indicates that an input raster is non-categorical data (continuous), while a
        value of "1" indicates that an input raster is categorical data.
            Column 3: The resampling method employed to interpolate new cell values when
        transforming the raster layer to the coordinate space or cell size of the template layer, if
        necessary. The resampling type should be specified using one of the following values:
        "nearestneighbor," "bilinear," "cubic," or "lanczos."
            Column 4: The aggregation method to be used in the event that the raster layer must be
        up-scaled to match the template layer (e.g., generalizing a 10 m input layer to a 100 m
        output layer). Care should be taken to ensure that the aggregation method that best
        preserves the integrity of the data is used. The aggregation should be specified using one
        of the following values: "Min," "Mean," "Max," "Majority," or "None."

        In formatting the list of predictor files, the titles assigned to each of the columns are
        unimportant as the module retrieves the information based on the order of the values in the
        .csv file (the ordering of the information and the permissible values in the file however,
        are strictly enforced). The module also anticipates a header row and will ignore the first
        row in the .csv file.
        Common connections:
            'value' port of PredictorListFile module

    templateLayer:  (mandatory)
        The templat layer raster file used to define the Extent, Cell size, Projection, raster snap,
        and coordinate system of the outputs.
        Common connections:
            'value' port of TemplateLayer module

    ignoreNonOverlap:  (optional)
        Option of using the intersection of all covariates and template or enforcing the template
        extent.
        Options are:
            True (checked) = Use intersection of all covariates extents.  Area of template extent
                    will be reduce such all covariate layers extents can be completely covered by
                    the new extent.
            False (Unchecked) = The template extent will be used for all outputs and an error will
                    be raised if any of the covariates are not completely covered by the template.

    multipleCores:  (optional)
        Option of running processing on multiple threads/cores.
        Options are:
            True (checked) = Individual layers will be run consectively on separate threads.
            False (Unchecked) = All processing will occur on the same thread as the main program.

Output Ports:
    RastersWithPARCInfoCSV:  (mandatory)
        The VisTrails output from the PARC module is a interim CSV file that contains information
        about each of the files processed.  This is used by the MDS builder to determine which files
        to extract values from and which layers are categorical.
        Common connections:
            Input port 'RastersWithPARCInfoCSV' of MDSBuilder module

Description:
        The SAHM Spatial Output Viewer Cell provides a convenient means for viewing the numerous
    spatial outputs produced by individual model runs as well as the input presence and absence
    points and background points if applicable.  The spatial viewer displays the outputs in an
    interactive Matplotlib chart which functions much like a full GIS.

        Attached to each cell is a toolbar that allows changing of the displayed layer and the
    overlaid points

Input Ports:
    row:  (optional)
        The spread sheet row that the output will be placed in. Counts start from 1 not 0.
        Default value = VisTrails will default to the next availible cell on the spreadsheet.

    column:  (optional)
        The spread sheet column that the output will be placed in. Counts start from 1 not 0.
        Default value = VisTrails will default to the next availible cell on the spreadsheet.

    ModelWorkspace:  (mandatory)
        The ModelWorkspace is a file titled modelWorkspace (no extension) that is saved in each
        model output folder.  All the individual outputs will be identified relative to the location
        of this file.

    InitialModelOutputDisplay:  (optional)
        The display tab to show initially.
        Options are:

RasterFormatConverter

Description:
        The RasterFormatConverter module allows a user to easily convert between raster file types
    for a group of rasters. This group can be specified as either all the rasters in a single
    directory or the rasters specified in a single MDS file (see below).  All outputs will be sent
    to a folder named "ConvertedRasters" (followed by an underscore and a number corresponding to
    the run sequence of the module) within the user's current VisTrail's session folder.  Typically
    this module will be used within a workflow to convert the geotiff format used by the rest of the
    modules to the ascii format needed by Maxent.  But the following file formats are accepted for
    both inputs and outputs: Arc/Info ASCII Grid, ESRI BIL, ERDAS Imagine, and JPEG and others.  See
    the compiled by default options at http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html for a complete list of
    the accepted file types.

Input Ports:
    inputMDS:  (optional)
        Any merged dataset (MDS) format csv can be used as input to this module.  All of the rasters
        pointed to in the third line of the file will be converted to the output format.
        Common connections:
            This can be connected to the output 'mdsFile' port on any of the following modules:
                    MDSBuilder, ModelEvaluationSplit, ModelSelectionSplit,
                    ModelCrossValidationSplit, or CovariateCorrelationAndSelection.

    inputDir:  (optional)
        An directory can be used to specify which files to process.  All of the rasters (of any
        format) will be converted to the output format specified.
        Common connections:
            This does not generally connect to any other SAHM modules.

    format:  (optional)
        The format to convert all the input grids into.  For Maxent this will be ASCII.
        Default value = Geotif
        Options are:
            Geotif
            Arc/Info Grid
            ASCII Grid
            ESRI Bil
            ERDAS Imagine
            JPEG
            BMP
            Additional uncommon file types are supported by GDAL.  For the complete list see the
                    'compiled by default' options at http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html for a
                    complete list of the accepted file types.

    multipleCores:  (optional)
        Option of running processing on multiple threads/cores.
        Options are:
            True (checked) = Individual layers will be run consectively on separate threads.
            False (Unchecked) = All processing will occur on the same thread as the main program.

Output Ports:
    outputDir:  (optional)
        The directory where all output files will be saved to.
        Default value = This directory name is created by the module and it will be located in the session folder.
        Common connections:
            This port will connect to the maxent input port 'projectionlayers'.

        <Definition>Determines how the threshold is set between to discretize continuous predictions into binary for evaluation metrics calculated based on the confusion matrix as well as for the binary map. The options, directly from the PresenceAbsences package in R are: 
    1:  Threshold=0.5
    2:  Sens=Spec sensitivity=specificity
    3:  MaxSens+Spec maximizes (sensitivity+specificity)/2
    4:  MaxKappa maximizes Kappa
    5:  MaxPCC maximizes PCC (percent correctly classified)
    6:  PredPrev=Obs predicted prevalence=observed prevalence
    7:  ObsPrev threshold=observed prevalence
    8:  MeanProb mean predicted probability
    9:  MinROCdist minimizes distance between ROC plot and (0,1)

The value calculated for the train portion of the data will be applied to the test portion and if cross validation was specified, the value is calculated separately for each fold using the threshold from the training data and applying it to the test data for each combination of folds.  </Definition>

        <PortName>ResidualsMap</PortName>
        <Definition>Model residual plots show the spatial relationship between the model deviance residuals.  Most models assume residuals will be independent thus spatial pattern in the deviance residuals can be indicative of a problem with the model fit and inference based on the fit.  It can for example indicate that important predictors were not included in the model and can be compared with the spatial pattern of predictors that were not included in the model.  Whether or not a significant spatial pattern exists in model residuals can at times be difficult to assess visually.  We hope to add correlograms of Moran’s I soon.  Unfortunately statistical tests based on the Moran’s I statistic for residuals of binary response models lack statistical justification and thus cannot be used to test for a significant spatial pattern (Bivand 2008).   See Dormann 2007 for more discussion on evaluation of model residuals and spatial models that are appropriate for species distribution modeling.  Residual plots can also be used to determine if certain observations contribute disproportionately to the deviance of the fitted model.  For a binary response model deviance residuals with absolute values greater than 2 can be indicative of a problem.</Definition>

        <PortName>MessMap</PortName>
        <Definition>If specified by selecting makeMESMap=TRUE the the MESS and MOD surfaces will be produced.  The MESS surface is the multivariate environment similarity surface and shows how well each point fits into the univariate ranges of the points for which the model was fit.  Negative values in this map indicate that the point is out of the range of the training data.  The MoD map is related and indicates which variable was furthest from the range over which the model was.  The MESS map takes the minimum value of a statistic calculate for each predictor and thus cannot diagnose hidden extrapolation as one might do using a hat matrix.  This surface is only calculated for variables that are selected in the model selection step within each model fitting algorithm so that variables that do not significantly affect the occurrence of the organism over the range of the training data will not be included in the MESS map even though these predictors might be significant outside the range in which the model was fit.  Random Forest never drops predictors so if one wishes to compare the MESS and Mod map before and after insignificant predictors were dropped, one can compare the MESS map of a Random Forest fit to that produced from the other model fit algorithms as long as they were fit using the same dataset.  See Elith et. al. 2010 for details on how the MESS map calculations are performed.</Definition>

        <Definition>For binary data this will be a Receiver operating characteristic curve.  Which shows the relationship between sensitivity and specificity as threshold for discretizing continuous predictions into presence absence is varied.  The threshold selected using the specified ThresholdOptimizationMethod is shown.  If a model selection test\training split was specified the ROC curve for this will be shown in red and if a cross validation split was specified a blue region will show the standard deviation for the cross validation folds.  If the model fits well both sensitivity and specificity should be well above the diagonal line.  If there is a strong disparity between the curves for the training data and either the testing split or cross validation standard deviation curves this can be indicative of model overfitting.  These plots and the evaluation metrics based on the confusion matrix describe the models ability to discriminate between presence and absence points.  The AUC value, or area under the ROC curve, is the probability that the model will rank a randomly chosen presence observation higher than a randomly chosen absence observation.  For count data this display will show several standard plots for assessment of model residuals .     </Definition>

        <Definition>This file contains a summary of  the model fit.  The information contained here includes the number of presence observations (counts equal to or greater than 1 for count models), the number of absence points, the number of covariates that were considered by the model selection algorithm.  Note all of these can differ from the numbers in the original .mds due to incomplete records being deleted, and predictors with only one unique value being removed.  The random number seed is recorded if applicable which allows completely reproducible results as well as a summary of the model fit.  Evaluation Statistics are reported for the data used to fit the model as well as for the test or cross-validation split if applicable.  References for how to interpret most of these are ubiquitous in the literature but it is worth mentioning that interpretation of the calibration statistics is described by Pearce and Ferrier 2000 as well as Miller and Hui 1991.  Most metrics reported here can also be found in related graphical displays.</Definition>

    MDS Builder

    The Merged Data Set (MDS) Builder module is a utility that extracts the values of each predictor
    layer to the point locations included in the field data set. The module produces a .csv file that
    contains the x and y locations of the sample points and a column indicating whether each point
    represents a presence recording, an absence recording, a presence count, or a background point.
    Following these first three columns, each environmental predictor layer is appended as a column
    with row entries representing the value present in the raster layer at each field sample point.
    There are a total of three header rows in the output .csv of the MDSBuilder. The first row contains
    the columns "x," "y," "ResponseBinary" or "ResponseCount," and the names of each of the raster
    predictor files that were passed to the MDS Builder. The second row contains a binary value
    indicating whether the column should be included when the model is finally applied; these values
    are later modified during the Covariate Correlation and Selection process that takes place downstream
    in the workflow. The final header row contains the full path on the file system to each of the raster
    predictor files.

    The MDSBuilder accepts four inputs from the user:

    1. Rasters with PARC Info .csv File: The raster layers listed in this file will have their values
    extracted to the points in the field data .csv file. This parameter should be supplied by connecting
    the output of a PARC module within the workflow to the MDSBuilder module. (In order to properly
    extract the values of each predictor layer to the field data points, all the layers must have matching
    coordinate systems and cell sizes; outputs from the PARC module will have had the prerequisite processing).
    
    2. Background Point Count: This is an optional value that applies only to workflows that employ the
    Maxent modeling package. The dialogue box provides the option of specifying a number of background points
    to be randomly scattered throughout the study area (the extent of the template layer) to capture a more
    complete sample of the range of values present for each predictor layer. These points will be added to
    the field data .csv file with a value of "-9999" denoting them as background points.
    
    3. Background Probability Surface: This is an optional parameter that applies only to workflows that
    employ the Maxent modeling package. In some analyses, it may be appropriate to spatially limit background
    points to a particular subset of the study area (e.g., islands within a study area polygon, particular
    regions within a study area polygon, or a region determined by the known bias present in the field data).
    Specifying a background probability surface raster allows a user to control where random points will be
    scattered within the extent of the study area. The raster layer specified by a user should have the same
    projection and extent as the template layer and contain values ranging from 0 to 100. These values represent
    the probability that a randomly generated point will be retained should it fall within a particular cell.
    That is, randomly generated points will not be generated in any part of the probability grid with a value
    of "0" while all points falling in an area with a value of "100" will be retained. A point falling in an
    area with a value of "50" will be kept as a background point 50% of the time.
    
    4. Field Data: The field data input corresponds to a .csv file containing presence/absence points or count
    data recorded across a landscape for the phenomenon being modeled (e.g., plant sightings, evidence of
    animal presence, etc.). This input file must be in a particular format, and in most cases, a user should
    populate this field by connecting a FieldData element to the MDSBuilder in the visual display within VisTrails.
    Please see the documention for the FieldData module for more details.

    <Title>FieldDataQuery</Title>
    <Description>Often raw field data come to us in a format that contains more information than we need to include in any single model.  This can take the form of additional columns that contain extraneous information, additional columns that contain occurrence data for additional species, or rows that from a time period, collection method, or species that we are not interested in modeling.  The Field Data Query module contains functionality to subset and reformat this output into the format used by the SAHM package.  
    Columns can be specified with either a positional argument (1, 2, 3, etc) if you want to select the first, second, third etc column.  Note these numbers start from 1.  Alternatively you can select a column based on name by entering the text of the column name found in the header.
    When selecting rows there are two types of queries that can be specified:
       Simple - Select a Query_Column and enter a value in the Query port.  If the value for a row in the selected column equals the value entered in the Query that row will be kept.  For example you might have a 'year' column and you would want to select all 2009 entries.  NOTE:  DO NOT ENCLOSE THE QUERY TEXT IN QUOTES IF YOU ARE TRYING TO MATCH A STRING!

       Complex - Optionally you can construct complex queries using Python syntax.  To do this enclose the column name in square brackets as part of a line of Python code.  Since the columns used are specified in the query string there is no need to use the Query_column port and it will be ignored.  For example to select years greater than 2005 you would use:  [year] &gt; 2005  To include string equality make sure you enclose the entire bracketed field name in quotes as well.  For example "[Observer]" == "Colin"  Complex queries involving multiple columns are possible as well, for example "[Observer]" != "Colin" and [year] &gt; 2005.

          <Option>    For the Query column you can either enter an equality statement with x used as a 
        placeholder to represent the values in the query column or you can construct 
        more involved queries using Python syntax.
        
        For example:
            x &lt; 2005 (would return values less than 2005)
            x == 2000 or x == 2009 (would return 2000 or 2009)
            The syntax is python in case you want to create an involved query.</Option>

        <PortName>ResidualsMap</PortName>
        <Definition>Model residual plots show the spatial relationship between the model deviance residuals.  Most models assume residuals will be independent thus spatial pattern in the deviance residuals can be indicative of a problem with the model fit and inference based on the fit.  It can for example indicate that important predictors were not included in the model and can be compared with the spatial pattern of predictors that were not included in the model.  Whether or not a significant spatial pattern exists in model residuals can at times be difficult to assess visually.  We hope to add correlograms of Moran’s I soon.  Unfortunately statistical tests based on the Moran’s I statistic for residuals of binary response models lack statistical justification and thus cannot be used to test for a significant spatial pattern (Bivand 2008).   See Dormann 2007 for more discussion on evaluation of model residuals and spatial models that are appropriate for species distribution modeling.  Residual plots can also be used to determine if certain observations contribute disproportionately to the deviance of the fitted model.  For a binary response model deviance residuals with absolute values greater than 2 can be indicative of a problem.</Definition>

        <PortName>MessMap</PortName>
        <Definition>If specified by selecting makeMESMap=TRUE the the MESS and MOD surfaces will be produced.  The MESS surface is the multivariate environment similarity surface and shows how well each point fits into the univariate ranges of the points for which the model was fit.  Negative values in this map indicate that the point is out of the range of the training data.  The MoD map is related and indicates which variable was furthest from the range over which the model was.  The MESS map takes the minimum value of a statistic calculate for each predictor and thus cannot diagnose hidden extrapolation as one might do using a hat matrix.  This surface is only calculated for variables that are selected in the model selection step within each model fitting algorithm so that variables that do not significantly affect the occurrence of the organism over the range of the training data will not be included in the MESS map even though these predictors might be significant outside the range in which the model was fit.  Random Forest never drops predictors so if one wishes to compare the MESS and Mod map before and after insignificant predictors were dropped, one can compare the MESS map of a Random Forest fit to that produced from the other model fit algorithms as long as they were fit using the same dataset.  See Elith et. al. 2010 for details on how the MESS map calculations are performed.</Definition>

        <Definition>For binary data this will be a Receiver operating characteristic curve.  Which shows the relationship between sensitivity and specificity as threshold for discretizing continuous predictions into presence absence is varied.  The threshold selected using the specified ThresholdOptimizationMethod is shown.  If a model selection test\training split was specified the ROC curve for this will be shown in red and if a cross validation split was specified a blue region will show the standard deviation for the cross validation folds.  If the model fits well both sensitivity and specificity should be well above the diagonal line.  If there is a strong disparity between the curves for the training data and either the testing split or cross validation standard deviation curves this can be indicative of model overfitting.  These plots and the evaluation metrics based on the confusion matrix describe the models ability to discriminate between presence and absence points.  The AUC value, or area under the ROC curve, is the probability that the model will rank a randomly chosen presence observation higher than a randomly chosen absence observation.  For count data this display will show several standard plots for assessment of model residuals .     </Definition>

The information contained here includes the number of presence observations (counts equal to or greater than 1 for count models), the number of absence points, the number of covariates that were considered by the model selection algorithm.  Note all of these can differ from the numbers in the original .mds due to incomplete records being deleted, and predictors with only one unique value being removed.  The random number seed is recorded if applicable which allows completely reproducible results as well as a summary of the model fit.  Evaluation Statistics are reported for the data used to fit the model as well as for the test or cross-validation split if applicable.  References for how to interpret most of these are ubiquitous in the literature but it is worth mentioning that interpretation of the calibration statistics is described by Pearce and Ferrier 2000 as well as Miller and Hui 1991.  Most metrics reported here can also be found in related graphical displays.</Definition>

    <Description>
    Model Evaluation Split

    The ModelEvaluationSplit module provides the opportunity to establish specific settings
    for how field data will be used in the modeling process. Three parameters can be set
    by the user:

    1. Ratio of Presence/Absence Points:
    This field is populated with a number corresponding to the desired proportion of
    presence and absence points to be used in the analysis. If populated, this entry should
    be a number greater than zero. (A value of '1' will result in an equal number of both
    presence and absence points being used, a value of '2' indicates that twice as many
    presence points will be used, a value of 0.5 indicates that twice as many absence points
    will be used, etc.). All field data points with a value equal to or greater than 1 are
    interpreted as presence points. Although the original field data is unmodified, this
    option will reduce the sample size as the merged dataset containing sample points will
    have points deleted from it to achieve the specified ratio. A warning will be generated
    if more than 50% of either the presence or absence points will be deleted based on the
    ratio specified by the user. Background points are ignored by this module (they are read
    in and written out, but not assigned to either the test or training split).

    When left empty, this field will default to 'null' and the model will use the existing
    presence/absence ratio present in the field data.

    2. Input Merged Data Set (MDS): 
    This is the input data set consisting of locational data for each sample point, the
    values of each predictor variable at those points, and if established, a field denoting
    the weight that will be assigned to each point in modeling. This input is usually provided
    by the upstream steps that precede the Test Training Split module. Any value entered here
    (e.g., specifying another existing MDS on the file system) will override the input
    specified by a model connection in the visual display.

    3. Training Proportion:
    This is the proportion of the sample points that will be used to train the model, relative
    to the total number of points. Entered values should be greater than 0 but less than 1.
    For example, a value of '0.9' will result in 90% of the sample points being used to train
    the model, with 10% of the sample being held out to test the model's performance. Choosing
    an appropriate training proportion can depend on various factors, such as the total number
    of sample points available.

        <Definition>Model residual plots show the spatial relationship between the model deviance residuals.  Most models assume residuals will be independent thus spatial pattern in the deviance residuals can be indicative of a problem with the model fit and inference based on the fit.  It can for example indicate that important predictors were not included in the model and can be compared with the spatial pattern of predictors that were not included in the model.  Whether or not a significant spatial pattern exists in model residuals can at times be difficult to assess visually.  We hope to add correlograms of Moran’s I soon.  Unfortunately statistical tests based on the Moran’s I statistic for residuals of binary response models lack statistical justification and thus cannot be used to test for a significant spatial pattern (Bivand 2008).   See Dormann 2007 for more discussion on evaluation of model residuals and spatial models that are appropriate for species distribution modeling.  Residual plots can also be used to determine if certain observations contribute disproportionately to the deviance of the fitted model.  For a binary response model deviance residuals with absolute values greater than 2 can be indicative of a problem.</Definition>

        <Definition>If specified by selecting makeMESMap=TRUE the the MESS and MOD surfaces will be produced.  The MESS surface is the multivariate environment similarity surface and shows how well each point fits into the univariate ranges of the points for which the model was fit.  Negative values in this map indicate that the point is out of the range of the training data.  The MoD map is related and indicates which variable was furthest from the range over which the model was.  The MESS map takes the minimum value of a statistic calculate for each predictor and thus cannot diagnose hidden extrapolation as one might do using a hat matrix.  This surface is only calculated for variables that are selected in the model selection step within each model fitting algorithm so that variables that do not significantly affect the occurrence of the organism over the range of the training data will not be included in the MESS map even though these predictors might be significant outside the range in which the model was fit.  Random Forest never drops predictors so if one wishes to compare the MESS and Mod map before and after insignificant predictors were dropped, one can compare the MESS map of a Random Forest fit to that produced from the other model fit algorithms as long as they were fit using the same dataset.  See Elith et. al. 2010 for details on how the MESS map calculations are performed.</Definition>

        <Definition>For binary data this will be a Receiver operating characteristic curve.  Which shows the relationship between sensitivity and specificity as threshold for discretizing continuous predictions into presence absence is varied.  The threshold selected using the specified ThresholdOptimizationMethod is shown.  If a model selection test\training split was specified the ROC curve for this will be shown in red and if a cross validation split was specified a blue region will show the standard deviation for the cross validation folds.  If the model fits well both sensitivity and specificity should be well above the diagonal line.  If there is a strong disparity between the curves for the training data and either the testing split or cross validation standard deviation curves this can be indicative of model overfitting.  These plots and the evaluation metrics based on the confusion matrix describe the models ability to discriminate between presence and absence points.  The AUC value, or area under the ROC curve, is the probability that the model will rank a randomly chosen presence observation higher than a randomly chosen absence observation.  For count data this display will show several standard plots for assessment of model residuals .     </Definition>

    Predictor List File

    The PredictorListFile module allows a user to load a .csv file containing a list
    of rasters for consideration in the modeled analysis. The .csv file should contain
    a header row and four columns containing the following information, in order, for
    each raster input. 
    
    Column 1: The full file path to the input raster layer.
    
    Column 2: A binary value indicating whether the input layer is categorical or not.
    A value of "0" indicates that an input raster is non-categorical data (continuous),
    while a value of "1" indicates that an input raster is categorical data.
    
    Column 3: The resampling method employed to interpolate new cell values when
    transforming the raster layer to the coordinate space or cell size of the template
    layer, if necessary. The resampling type should be specified using one of the following
    values: "nearestneighbor," "bilinear," "cubic," or "lanczos."
    
    Column 4: The aggregation method to be used in the event that the raster layer
    must be up-scaled to match the template layer (e.g., generalizing a 10 m input layer to a
    100 m output layer). Care should be taken to ensure that the aggregation method that
    best preserves the integrity of the data is used. The aggregation should be specified
    using one of the following values: "Min," "Mean," "Max," "Majority," or "None."

    In formatting the list of predictor files, the titles assigned to each of the columns
    are unimportant as the module retrieves the information based on the order of the
    values in the .csv file (the ordering of the information and the permissible values
    in the file however, are strictly enforced). The module also anticipates a header row
    and will ignore the first row in the .csv file.

        <PortName>ResidualsMap</PortName>
        <Definition>Model residual plots show the spatial relationship between the model deviance residuals.  Most models assume residuals will be independent thus spatial pattern in the deviance residuals can be indicative of a problem with the model fit and inference based on the fit.  It can for example indicate that important predictors were not included in the model and can be compared with the spatial pattern of predictors that were not included in the model.  Whether or not a significant spatial pattern exists in model residuals can at times be difficult to assess visually.  We hope to add correlograms of Moran’s I soon.  Unfortunately statistical tests based on the Moran’s I statistic for residuals of binary response models lack statistical justification and thus cannot be used to test for a significant spatial pattern (Bivand 2008).   See Dormann 2007 for more discussion on evaluation of model residuals and spatial models that are appropriate for species distribution modeling.  Residual plots can also be used to determine if certain observations contribute disproportionately to the deviance of the fitted model.  For a binary response model deviance residuals with absolute values greater than 2 can be indicative of a problem.</Definition>

        <PortName>MessMap</PortName>
        <Definition>If specified by selecting makeMESMap=TRUE the the MESS and MOD surfaces will be produced.  The MESS surface is the multivariate environment similarity surface and shows how well each point fits into the univariate ranges of the points for which the model was fit.  Negative values in this map indicate that the point is out of the range of the training data.  The MoD map is related and indicates which variable was furthest from the range over which the model was.  The MESS map takes the minimum value of a statistic calculate for each predictor and thus cannot diagnose hidden extrapolation as one might do using a hat matrix.  This surface is only calculated for variables that are selected in the model selection step within each model fitting algorithm so that variables that do not significantly affect the occurrence of the organism over the range of the training data will not be included in the MESS map even though these predictors might be significant outside the range in which the model was fit.  Random Forest never drops predictors so if one wishes to compare the MESS and Mod map before and after insignificant predictors were dropped, one can compare the MESS map of a Random Forest fit to that produced from the other model fit algorithms as long as they were fit using the same dataset.  See Elith et. al. 2010 for details on how the MESS map calculations are performed.</Definition>

        <Definition>For binary data this will be a Receiver operating characteristic curve.  Which shows the relationship between sensitivity and specificity as threshold for discretizing continuous predictions into presence absence is varied.  The threshold selected using the specified ThresholdOptimizationMethod is shown.  If a model selection test\training split was specified the ROC curve for this will be shown in red and if a cross validation split was specified a blue region will show the standard deviation for the cross validation folds.  If the model fits well both sensitivity and specificity should be well above the diagonal line.  If there is a strong disparity between the curves for the training data and either the testing split or cross validation standard deviation curves this can be indicative of model overfitting.  These plots and the evaluation metrics based on the confusion matrix describe the models ability to discriminate between presence and absence points.  The AUC value, or area under the ROC curve, is the probability that the model will rank a randomly chosen presence observation higher than a randomly chosen absence observation.  For count data this display will show several standard plots for assessment of model residuals .     </Definition>

        <Definition>This file contains a summary of  the model fit.  The information contained here includes the number of presence observations (counts equal to or greater than 1 for count models), the number of absence points, the number of covariates that were considered by the model selection algorithm.  Note all of these can differ from the numbers in the original .mds due to incomplete records being deleted, and predictors with only one unique value being removed.  The random number seed is recorded if applicable which allows completely reproducible results as well as a summary of the model fit.  Evaluation Statistics are reported for the data used to fit the model as well as for the test or cross-validation split if applicable.  References for how to interpret most of these are ubiquitous in the literature but it is worth mentioning that interpretation of the calibration statistics is described by Pearce and Ferrier 2000 as well as Miller and Hui 1991.  Most metrics reported here can also be found in related graphical displays.</Definition>

    The TemplateLayer is a raster data layer with a defined coordinate system, a known cell size,
    and an extent that defines the study area. This raster layer serves as the template for all
    the other inputs in the analysis. All additional raster layers used in the analysis will be
    resampled and reprojected as needed to match the template, snapped to the template, and
    clipped to have an extent that matches the template. Users should ensure that any additional
    layers considered in the analysis have coverage within the extent of the template layer.

    The TemplateLayer is a required input for the PARC module.

    Covariate Correlation And Selection

    The CovariateCorrelationAndSelection view provides a breakpoint in the modeling workflow
    for the user to assess how well each variable explains the distribution of the sampled
    data points and to remove any variables that may exhibit high correlation with others. 

    The display shows the 10 most correlated variables of those selected. These variables
    are displayed on the diagonal and their respective graphical display and correlation with
    other variables can be found by locating the row/column intersection between each (above
    and below the diagonal). The column heading over each variable displays the number of
    other variables with which the environmental predictor is correlated. The user defined
    "Threshold" option allows a user to specify the degree of correlation required between
    two variables for them to be counted in this tally.

    A user is provided with the opportunity to select a new set of the environmental predictor
    variables and "Update" the Covariate Correlation screen to investigate the relationships
    among the new variables selected. The options are provided to include or exclude the
    presence/count points, the absence points (when applicable), and the background points in
    this correlation test. Variables with a high degree of correlation with other variables
    should generally be unchecked in their respective radio buttons, and will be excluded from
    subsequent analysis steps in the model workflow.

    Multiple iterations can be run at this screen, allowing the user to investigate the
    relationships among the environmental predictor variables and choose the most appropriate
    set to be used in the subsequent modeling. When the desired set of variables has been chosen,
    the "OK" button is selected and processing will resume in the VisTrails workflow.

    <Description>
    Field Data

    The FieldData module allows a user to add presence/absence points or count data recorded across a
    landscape for the phenomenon being modeled (e.g., plant sightings, evidence of animal presence, etc.).
    The input data for this module must be in the form of a .csv file that follows one of two formats: 

    Format 1
    A .csv file with the following column headings, in order: "X," "Y," and "responseBinary".
    In this case, the "X" field should be populated with the horizontal (longitudinal) positional
    data for a sample point. The "Y" field should be populated with the vertical (latitudinal) data
    for a sample point. These values must be in the same coordinate system/units as the template
    layer used in the workflow. The column "responseBinary" should be populated with either a '0'
    (indicating absence at the point) or a '1' (indicating presence at the point).

    Format 2
    A .csv file with the following column headings, in order: "X," "Y," and "responseCount".
    In this case, the "X" field should be populated with the horizontal (longitudinal) positional
    data for a sample point. The "Y" field should be populated with the vertical (latitudinal) data
    for a sample point. These values must be in the same coordinate system/units as the template
    layer used in the workflow. The column "responseCount" should be populated with either a '-9999'
    (indicating that the point is a background point) or a numerical value (either '0' or a positive integer)
    indicating the number of incidences of the phenomenon recorded at that point.

          <Option>Collapse In Pixel : All field data points falling within a single pixel will be collapse into a single point at the center of that pixel.  If using Presense(Absense) data the point will be given a value of 1 if any are presense, otherwise 0 if any are absense, otherwise -9999 if all are background.  If using count data the point value will be the sum of all points in a pixel.
    Weight Per Pixel : All field data points are retained but a weight column is added and points in pixels with multiple points are given a weight of 1 over the number of points in that pixel.  For example all the points in a pixel with 4 points would be given a weight of 1/4.
    Inverse Density : Sets point weights inversely proportional to their spatial proximity to other points using an isotropic Gaussian smoothing kernel to calculate the density using the density.ppp function in the spatstat library in R using the leaveoneout=TRUE option which calculates the density at each point ignoring the point itself so that a completely isolated point will have weight equal to 1.  The standard deviation of the kernel is by default a function of the area of the minimum convex polygon containing all points.  This can optionally be set and explored by the user and an option is available to set this parameter to half the pixel length.  The density calculated for the points is multiplied by 2??2 to adjust for the height of the Gaussian.  Once the density is calculated, weights are set equal to  1/sqrt(1+density at the point).
    Total Presence = Total Absence :  Sets weights so the sum of the weights for presence points is equal to the sum of the weights for absence point by down-weighting absences.  Presence points will have weight 1. 

Note - that currently only GLM, MARS, and Boosted Regression Trees accept weights.  Any Weights column will be ignored by Random Forest and Maxent.  </Option>

    <Description>
    Predictor
    
    The Predictor module allows a user to select a single raster layer for consideration in the
    modeled analysis. Four parameters must be specified by the user:
    
    1. Aggregation Method: The aggregation method to be used in the event that the raster layer
    must be up-scaled to match the template layer (e.g., generalizing a 10 m input layer to a
    100 m output layer). Care should be taken to ensure that the aggregation method that
    best preserves the integrity of the data is used.
    
    2. Resample Method: The resample method employed to interpolate new cell values when
    transforming the raster layer to the coordinate space or cell size of the template layer,
    if necessary. 
    
    3. Categorical (Boolean): Checking this box indicates that the data contained in the raster
    layer is categorical (e.g. landcover categories). Leaving this box unchecked indicates that
    the data contained in the raster is continuous (e.g., a DEM layer). This distinction is important
    in determining an appropriate resampling method.
    
    4. File Path: The location of the raster predictor file, which a user can specify by navigating to the
    file's location on their file system. When a user is selecting an ESRI grid raster, the user should navigate
    to the 'hdr.adf' file contained within the grid folder. 
    
    Accepted formats include:
        ESRI Grid ('.bil', or the folder, or 'hdr.adf' file in the folder, see above)
        GeoTiffs('.tif')
        Imagine('.img')
        ASCII('.asc')
        Bitmap('.bmp')
        Jpeg('.jpg')

                                    http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html
