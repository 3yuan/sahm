environmentallayers,e,Directory ,,"If this is not supplied we will create a SWD version of this from the background points generated from sahm, i.e. -9998 or -9999 in the MDS response column.",
biasfile,,File ,,"Sampling is assumed to be biased according to the sampling distribution given in this grid file.
Values in this file must not be zero or negative. MaxEnt will factor out the bias.
Requires environmental data to be in grids, rather than a SWD format file 
",This will be ignored if environmentallayers is not selected.
randomtestpoints ,X ,Integer ,0,"Percentage of presence localities to be randomly set aside as test points, used to compute AUC, omission etc. ","If the MDS input is from the test training split the will not be used, but instead this file will be generated from the input MDS Split column where it equals 'test'"
betamultiplier ,b ,Float ,1.0,Multiply all automatic regularization parameters by this number. A higher number gives a more spread-out distribution. ,
maximumbackground ,MB ,Integer ,10000,"If the number of background points / grid cells is larger than this number, then this number of cells is chosen randomly for background points ",
testsamplesfile ,T ,File ,,"Use the presence localities in this file to compute statistics (AUC, omission etc.)
The file can contain different localities for different species.
It takes precedence over the random test percentage. ",
replicates ,,Integer ,1,"Number of replicate runs to do when cross-validating, bootstrapping or doing sampling with replacement runs ",If we supply the testsamples file or generate one from our testtraining split data can this also supplied?  I think not.
replicatetype ,,String ,"'subsample'","If replicates > 1, do multiple runs of this type:
Crossvalidate: samples divided into replicates folds; each fold in turn used for test data.
Bootstrap: replicate sample sets chosen by sampling with replacement.
Subsample: replicate sample sets chosen by removing random test percentage without replacement to be used for evaluation.
